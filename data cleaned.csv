0,Free Smoke,"[Intro: Nai Palm & Drake]
Is it the strength of your feelings
Overthrowing your pain?
You'll see new heights you’ll be reaching
And is it today that you will find your new release?
And in your wake, ripple your sweet fate
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was stayin’ up at yo' place
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing
I saw people doin' things
Almost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped
All that yappin' on the phone shit
You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit
[Chorus: Drake]
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy

[Verse 2: Drake]
Dom Rosé toast
Hidden Hills where I post
I start my day slow
Silk pajamas when I wake though
Miraval to the face though
I drunk text J-Lo
Old number, so it bounce back
Boi-1da got the bounce back
Used to get paid for shows in front-door money
Five, ten, twenties, hand sanitize after you count that
Me and Gibbo was about that
Eatin' Applebee's and Outback
Southwest, no first class
Hilton rooms, gotta double up
Writin’ our name on a double cup
We ain’t even have a tour bus
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin’ me
I fall asleep in sororities
I had some different priorities
Weezy had all the authority
Women I like was ignorin' me
Now they like, ""Aren't you adorable?""
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef KD
Now me and Chef, KD
Bet on shots for twenty G's
I brought the game to its knees
I make too much these days to ever say, ""Poor me""
Where you at? I never see you
","
is it the strength of your feelings
overthrowing your pain
youll see new heights you’ll be reaching

Yeah
It's a Habibis ting, ya?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, my side girl got a 5S with the screen cracked
Still hit me back right away, better not never hesitate
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch, tryna light the way
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic
'Cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Had fans, but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, ""How is niggas really gettin' down?""
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150,000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now
[Chorus: Quavo]
Hell nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these niggas ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah

Griselda Blanco with the trap moves (Trappin')
Gangland with the right hand (Gang)
Undertaker with the tattoos (Tats)
Never listen to the class rules (No)
Switch it up, they bit the last move (Let's go!)
I'm a magnet for bad bitches (Magnet)
You got the goin' out sad bitches (Sad)
I spent a fifty on the chain (Racks)
You spent your last fifty (Ugh, cash)
I got the keys to the streets (Keys)
You got the key to defeat (Defeated)

11,Sacrifices,"[Verse 1:  Drake]
Wrote this shit, January 21
Baby girl, I had to run, I'll be back a couple months
Kendall turned 21, was up the street with 21
They could see me online, but they won't see me on the ones
I got Dubai plates in the California state
I got her waitin' at my place, I got no baby on the way
I'm talkin' Baby like Stunna, I'm talkin' Baby like Face
Lost millions in the past, I'm talkin' maybe like eight
Couple niggas from the city
Wishin' on a star, could they be like Drake
Sorry, no, not today, you gotta find your own way
Big dog from the 6, I'm talkin' Dogg like Nate
My shit be raw out the gate, I don't need another take
40 got house on the lake, I ain't know we had a lake
She complainin' how I'm late, I ain't know it was a date
Niggas see me in person
First thing they say is, ""I know you need a break.""
Hell naw, I feel great, ready now, why wait?
Like a kiss from a rose I could be the one to seal your whole fate
So be careful what you think, think about what you gon' say
Gotta deal with people straight, I got my 23's laced
It's a marathon, not a sprint, but I still gotta win the race, yeah
[Chorus: Drake]
And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to Him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to—

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz, I'm a real one
Few shows, that's a mil run
When she bust it down
I said, ""Thanks for givin' to me,"" like a pilgrim
Cold world'll be chillin'
Earmuffs on the children
Used to trap out the Hilton
Got wood on the Cartiers: that's a face full of splinters
Count a bankroll for dinner
This the wrong place to enter
Phone sex for breakfast, all kinda women text us
Met her at the Super Bowl
Told her I stayed down the street from Texas
A-Town, I stay down, yeah it's all in the wrist
This one here out the fence
Trap jumpin' like “tha Carter”, mean it jumpin' like Vince
Moved on from the election
Introduced her to the plug
Can't believe they tried to take the connection
Ooh, girl, you a blessin', fine ass, be finessin'
Yeah I love my fans but I don't wanna take pictures in the restroom
Drench God with the 6 God
Point guard and the two guard
""Pretty Girls Like Trap Music"" so I woke up with my wood hard

12,Nothings Into Somethings,"[Intro: DJ Paul]
You ever hear some slow tracks, you know what I'm sayin'?
With, like, some pimpin' to it, or somethin'
That you can relax, pop a top to, or somethin'?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Big cup of Ac', I'm drowsy
I'm still posted up where you first found me
Did I just read that you just got engaged on me?
I heard from your friend, you couldn't even tell me
Or better yet, wait on me

Nah, sha-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah

A statement or something?
Ask about that, you would say it was nothing
But here's another nothing that you made into something
Can't just leave it off that way","

13,Teenage Fever,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you, you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind so

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?

Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess? I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess? I should have stayed

15,Lose You,"[Intro: John Taylor & Drake]
I don't care what society thinks. They're nothing anyway. They're no better than me. Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you. Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself. (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
No snow tires, the Range slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to ""Ignition,"" hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah
[Chorus: Drake]
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that’s takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That’s not respectable all of a sudden?
I don’t get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you

I don't know; first, you caught the hands, then you took the stand
It's a joke, but you say you real—I don't understand
On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the road
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those
Started out doin' college shows, Calipari flow
Then I popped like you never seen, we with everything
I went off in the '16, give me '17
[Chorus: Drake]
Want a lot, can't have everything, can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything, but I want everything

[Verse 2: Drake]
Bad attitude, tellin' who to calm down?
Tryna cool it all down, who's callin' my name?
Who's involved now? Tell me who I gotta down
I'll do a song now, man
Even though there's way less to prove to y'all now, man
Everything that went around is comin' back around
Y'all better hit the ground
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished
Yeah, it's all open-ended, had me off for a minute
Had you all since beginnin'
Damn, I must be coachin', 'cause I'm not playin' with them
Can you not see the difference?
I mean, I keep the fuckin' lights on in the buildin'
Man, my record deal should be 500 million, goddamn

[Chorus: Drake]
Can't have everything, can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything, but I want everything

[Verse 3: Drake]
Finally got my mind in a free state
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak
I gave them back a clean plate
Same niggas preein' cause they hate to see the team straight
Same niggas beakin', always duckin' my release dates
That's when the phone starts ringin', like, ""Are we straight?""
Two-faced niggas back around with the three-face, damn
Ol' triple-double-Russ face, watch-with-the bust face
Never-met-the-plug-but-I-rap-about-the-plug face
Never-met-myself, I-don't-remember-who-I-was face
Y'all fuckin' hilarious
Y'all really think y'all niggas teamin' up is scarin' us
Y'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton
All that shit embarrassin'
Tell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again
He ain't even die, and I ball with his inheritance
All that's in my account at the Bank of America
All that Drake hysteria
6 side, East side, all that for my area

I hate being alone
But you finally got me out my zone
I know and I miss you
Know when I'm tripping
Oh, yes it's difficult
Thank God I'm Christian
Remember how this all begun, just us
My mama said you was bad news
Like, ""Dun-dun-dun-dun""
You proved her right, every single night
Oh my, oh my, can't close my eyes
Can't open my eyes, don't know what to do
I'm in some kind of mood
You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful

Couldn't tell you what's not yours

You said that you think about me every day
Saturday to Saturday
You see that I've been goin' through it
Hopin' everything's okay
I just want to let you know
Everything these days is textual
I just want to get a lil' sexual, with you
'Cause I remember way, way back
With the waves under the wave cap
You were someone else's wife in fact
You didn't even look at me like that
Then it all just switched, over time
Step by step and you know what's next

21,Do Not Disturb,"[Intro: Snoh Aalegra]
Silence keeps cloudin' me
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered
[Verse: Drake]
Yeah, stylin’ though
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need forty-thousand people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute while I was writin’ Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assured that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dawg, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back 2018 to give you the summary

More time with family and friends. More Life.
 
I've still got vibrations to send. More Life.
 
They say that we could live forever
 
At night I pray it's true

Sooner than we're all expecting

23,Fireworks,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Money just changed everything
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Looking down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear 'em talking, I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit
Yeah, and my dreams are who I'm racing with
But you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
October's Own but it's looking like July 4
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really going off, fireworks

24,Karaoke,"[Produced by Francis and the Lights]

[Verse 1: Drake]
Things have been so crazy and hectic
I shoulda gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better anyhow
So if you gotta go
If there's anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose

[Verse 2: Drake]
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore?
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm off singing karaoke
Further than I've ever been
So if you gotta go
If there's any way I can help

[Verse 3: Drake]
Isn't it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner
That tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you'd choose somewhere
That had somebody that you know
I'm always up too late, I worry 'bout you there alone
In that place you call your home, warm nights and cold Patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy
'Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories 'bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell

Yesterday when we were getting high
You were invited, you would’a liked it

I said that we could kiss the past goodbye
But you weren't excited
There's no way to fight it
You can stay but shawty, here I go

Uh, should I spend a weekend in Vegas?
I'm living inside a moment, not taking pictures to save it
I mean, how could I forget? My memory's never faded
I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it
I am still here with who I started with
The game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some mortar shit
Carry the weight for my city like a cargo ship
Uh, I'm 23 with a money tree
Growing more too, I just planted a hundred seeds
It's ironic 'cause my mother was a florist
And that's how she met my pops
And now my garden is enormous
""It's happening, Penny Lane, just like you said!""
I avoided the coke game and went with Sprite instead
Uh-uh, that's word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough

i blew myself up im on some mortar shit
carry the weight for my city like a cargo ship
uh im 23 with a money tree
growing more too i just planted a hundred seeds
its ironic cause my mother was a florist
and thats how she met my pops
and now my garden is enormous
its happening penny lane just like you said
i avoided the coke game and went with sprite instead
uhuh thats word to the millions that they putting up
im trying to do better than good enough

26,Over,"[Produced by Boi-1da and Nick Brongers]

[Intro]
Uh, uh
Young Money
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Verse 1]
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
""Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either""
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it
",
27,Show Me a Good Time,"[Pre-Chorus]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby

[Chorus]
Show me a good time (Aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (Aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time (Aw yeah, aw yeah)

[Verse 1]
I live for the nights that I can't remember
With the people that I won't forget
Spending all the money I just worked my ass off for
Doing things that I won't regret
I've been waiting way too long, long, long, long
Telling everybody that I know we about to be on, on, on, on
I ain't trying to look like I lied to these niggas
That I came up with, that's my team
Never would I let a woman come between
What we doing right now, this our dream
Wu-Tang Clan, niggas want that cream
I'm the Osiris to this shit right now
Go-to guy for the hits right now
Whatever you wanna drink girl, pick right now
If you can't hold your liquor, better quit right now
",
28,Up All Night,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Kush rolled, glass full: I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm havin' a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time
She ain't tryna pop that shit for pimp; okay, well nevermind
I-I-I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothin' nice
Bracelet saying ""you should quit"", cars saying ""fuck your life""
Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up, I got the voodoo for you bitches (yeah)
I'm busy gettin' rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas, boy: stunt double
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip, just peace, happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
'Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww

29,Fancy,"[Produced by Swizz Beatz & Noah ""40"" Shebib]

[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Go, go 'head (Go, go, go)
Go, go, go 'head (Go, go, go)
Go, go, go, go, go, go 'head
Go, go, go, go, go, go 'head

You—you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, you getting ready so I know we gon' be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyle
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you droppin' 10 pounds preparin' for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself, you the fucking coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a lil' class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think nobody does it better
I love the way that you put it together, uh

30,Shut It Down,"[Part I]

[Intro: Drake]
Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, say baby, I had to mention
That if you were a star, you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls they, they got attention
But I just always feel like they're in need of something you got
It's obvious you're pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Tryna take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong, got this little song
For you to get ready to, put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures

[Chorus: Drake]
Shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) 'round (Aye) 'round (Aye)
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You would shut it down (Aye) down (Aye) down (Aye)
You'd be the baddest girl around (Aye) 'round (Aye) 'round (Aye)
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it—

Let me know, let me know
Ahhh, let me know
Let me know, let me know

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uhh, yeah
This is really one of my dumbest flows ever, I haven’t slept in days
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways
So I’m single, thinkin' 'bout what we had and missin' you
But I ain't Santa, I got somethin' for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me, tryin' not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don’t hold on too long 'cause that’s how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your muthafuckin' heart out
It's Drizzy, always gone but never hard to find
And since you can’t escape me, do I ever cross your mind?
Because all this shit is new to me, I’m learnin' to behave
And still spendin' every dollar they encourage me to save
But I’m good, I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle
I’m lookin' forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin' from where I came
And no matter where I’m headed, I promise to stay the same
I'm just

[Chorus: Jeezy & Drake]
I’m just ridin' 'round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl, I’m the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talkin' 'bout the greatest
I just really hope that (I just really hope that you'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)
I just really hope that (You'll think of me)

32,Light Up,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, I've been up for four days, gettin' money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffers and low fades
I keep thinkin', how young can you die from old age?
They always tell me: ""Nobody's workin' as hard as you""
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
'Cause while all of my closest friends out partyin'
I'm just here makin' all the music that they party to
But party on, party on all night, nigga
I got these new rappers nervous: prom night, nigga
I grow tired of these fuckin' grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uh, but I just want to tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
The shit feel like when Fredro Starr
Was in Sunset Park stuntin' hard in his yellow goose - yeah!
And I'm a motherfuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless, and I just started
Was that directed at moi? Can't be
They must be talkin' to themselves, Hov: hands free
Yeah, and I'm just fillin' up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star: no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends: Kelsey Grammer
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doin' you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you
And if you pillow-talkin' with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga
When she through with you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all, even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I got to feel alive, even if it kills me
Promise to always give you me, the real me

Drizzy back up in this thing, I'm ready, what's hannenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, yo' bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me, I look like I hit the lotto twice
Drake, you got 'em, right? Yeah, I got 'em, Bun
I love myself 'cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table, stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin', basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever gotta sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl, I'm fuckin' serious, I'm wit' it if you wit' it
'Cause yo' verses turn me on and yo' pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn! I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealin' flows 'cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we blowin'

Well, alright
Here I go

[Verse 1]
Uh, Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
Lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle
Alohas to women with no ties to men
That I know well, that way there are no lies
You can thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
I'm on the brink of ""influential,"" I'm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch, what a year for you niggas
It's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
You got your resolutions, we just got reservations
Living out a dream it feels like I stayed up
And we just want to party, Patron straight up
Fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
OVO Clique, Red Wing Boot Gang
Yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
Who'd have thought the route we'd chosen
Would ever end up this scenic?
I can relate to kids going straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And that's around the time
That your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike
But got to A.I. him for your survival
Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous
Cause we want to be them, and they want to be us
So on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment
That you take for granted, y-you can thank me now
And oh my goodness you're welcome, you're welcome
At this point me is who I am trying to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
'Cause they think that I can help them
Get back to where they fell from
But drink up, 'cause everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggas that I came with, they good for life
Yeah, that's how you know it's going down
In case another chance never comes around

37,9AM in Dallas,"[Verse]
These are my One St. Thomas flows
Me, my niggas and some Madonna hoes
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go
Discussing life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds glow
Fine dining pour another glass when the wine is low
I'm in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling
Whatever it is I got, it's clearly appealing
These other rappers getting that inferior feeling
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healing
Take a look at yourself, the mirror's revealing
If you ain't got it, you ain't got it the theory is brilliant
People ask how music is going, I heard it pays
I just came off making two million in 30 days
Damn, ""I guess it does"" is what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spending my money just because
With Weezy I'm just out here repping us
'til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessing us
Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smelling like teen spirit
I ask kindly if no one out here would bring defeat up
Until I lose, for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up
Who you like, tell me who it is
I'mma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list
I should call it a night, but fuck it I can't resist
This one is for all the niggas from my city trying to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail, that feeling there is the shit
I swear, pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass looking down, pick ya head up
No one told you your disguise was the most ridiculous get-up?
With nose-plugs in now, I can smell the set-up
So you just wasting your time, you only making me better, yeah
I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chase N. Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club
Damn, that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in the couch
Now we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time, everything just clicked
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict?
Considering the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect for y'all to get
I'm nervous but I'mma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in
Throwing up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen
But still throwing touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses, hopin' that someone catch it
People say that old Drake, we startin' to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Is this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression
Ducking your questions, fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of Essence
I'm allergic to coming in second but I never sneeze
Y.M.O.E. nigga, yeah

39,Over My Dead Body,"[Intro: Chantal Kreviazuk]
How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
'Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself, ""Why do you worry?""
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Verse 1: Drake]
I think I killed everybody in the game last year
Man, fuck it, I was on, though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at the strip club
Mmm-mmm, fuck it, I was wrong, though
Shout out to all my niggas livin' tax-free
Nowadays, it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga, yeah
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy, but I'm just playin' the field, nigga, yeah
Are these people really discussin' my career again?
Askin' if I'll be goin' platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man, all of your flows bore me, paint dryin'
And I don't ever be trippin' off of what ain't mine
And I be hearin' the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time, yeah
It's been that way from the beginnin'
I just been playin', I ain't even notice I was winnin'
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright
[Chorus: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Oh, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body
[Verse 2: Drake]
You say I'm old news, well, who the new star?
'Cause if I'm goin' anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a bar mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over fed time
But shout out to the niggas that's doin' dead time
And shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start, boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfuckin' funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah, it's whatever
You know, feelin' good, livin' better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back pavin' the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it
And I was drinkin' at the Palms last night
And ended up losin' everything that I came with, yeah
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got ten years to go, huh?
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

40,Shot for Me,"[Verse 1]
I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got shit on what you're feelin' now
Mad 'cause he ain't like me
Oh, you mad 'cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Alisha, Catya, I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah, I said it
Bitch, I'm the man, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now, that's me
That's me
And the voice in your ear, that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah, I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your latest
Yeah, I'm the reason why you always gettin' faded
[Chorus]
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)

A shot for me (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
A shot for me

[Verse 2]
Okay, look, I'm honest, girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says, ""I know you changed
I never see you 'cause you're always busy doin' things""
I really wish she had a different way of viewin' things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends tellin' you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your Mr. Perfect
I could tell that you been cryin' all night, drinkin' all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover, uh
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

[Chorus]
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)

41,Headlines,"[Verse 1]
I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
'Cause one of us goes in and we all go through it (Ayy)
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gon' pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know
[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I be yellin' out, ""Money over everything,"" money on my mind
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, ""They miss the old Drake,"" girl, don't tempt me
""If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do""
I'm like, ""Why I gotta be all that?""
But still, I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap-opera rappers, all these niggas sound like all my children
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'?
I guess it really is just me, myself, and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
'Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know

Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fuckin' sing-along
So, girl, what you singin' for?
It's 'cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowin' like a C4
Twenty, keep the bar rollin'
Fake IDs in the trash, we goin'
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowin'
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash comin' straight from Poland

Why? 'Cause they loving the crew

Oh, they loving the crew

Yeah
Smokin' weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know where Harvard gets us
But seein' my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times where I might blow like 50K on a vacation
For all my soldiers, just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say, ""Your lyrics do shit for me""
I told my story and made history
Tell them I'ma need reservations for twenty
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
I'd much rather spend it all while I'm breathin'
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know

43,Take Care,"[Chorus: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 1: Drake]
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinkin' that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, aw
Pushing me away so I give her space, aw
Dealin' with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I would care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

'Cause if you let me
Here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost

[Verse 2: Drake]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're followin' your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate bein' alone, well, you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you somethin'
To save you, instead, they say

Don't, tell me, I don't care if you hurt

45,Buried Alive Interlude,"[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Box
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in and, and fall asleep, I, I fall asleep
'Cause, 'cause, 'cause you, 'cause you are the death of me
'Cause you are the—
If you was in a pine box, box

'Cause you are the—

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Lookin' in the mirror, I'm embarrassed
I'm feelin' like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man, arm wrestlin' hands I was dealt
When I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it, I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that'd keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar
Women love when you're my type
And you're winnin' from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel
Live the ambiance all 'cause the audience one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse bein' read
I'ma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat, capitalize that
And your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Trackin' device on your used 5 Series
I don't call back, just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say we in the area cruisin' in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular, thought he was gonna sell me a false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors, all that nigga was missin' was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation, a reality livin' in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the tastemakers for the shit we makin'
Then he said that he was the same age as
Myself, and it didn't help 'cause it made me even more rude and impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO
The reason why I'm breathin' all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend say she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why the highlight was when he said
You belong to the people when you outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy
Full of fame and bury yourself alive, then I died","

that gave him an addiction thatd keep him in mercedes benz
bright lights and rihanna as a lady friend
my vice is similar
women love when youre my type
and youre winnin from everything that your palm write
put her in the palms hotel sin city
devil in a dress platinum chanel
live the ambiance all cause the audience one day said i would do it
so instead of a verse bein read
ima go and get some head off the strength of my music
i tell a bad bitch your ass too fat capitalize that
and your weave look good with the indian tracks
trackin device on your used 5 series
i dont call back just blame it on your canadian
the same day we say we in the area cruisin in toronto
hit me on the cellular thought he was gonna sell me a false word like the rappers i know
sat down with a few drinks located where you cant see us
a white waitress on standby when we need her
a black maybach 40 pulled up jeep
no doors all that nigga was missin was aaliyah
felt like the initiation a reality livin in the matrix
we talk casually about the industry
and how the women be the tastemakers for the shit we makin
then he said that he was the same age as
myself and it didnt help cause it made me even more rude and impatient
so blame it on mr ovoxo
the reason why im breathin all the vanity i know
the reason why my best friend say she love me more than life
but i live a double life and need to let her go
the reason why the highlight was when he said
you belong to the people when you outside
so dig a shovel full of money full of power full of pussy
full of fame and bury yourself alive then i died"
46,Under Ground Kings,"[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even see it straight, I can't even see it straight, ah
Fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, 'cause niggas die a lot
And lie a lot, but I'm the truth, that's right, I fuckin' said it
The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven
You, girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How'd I know? How'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I could tell a lie if you askin' me my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches, rap and bitches, bitches and rappin'
Rappin' and bitches until all of it switches, I swear
It's been two years since somebody asked me who I was
I'm the greatest, man, I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing, ""Walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga,"" ah
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm gettin' back to my ways
[Chorus]
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately, I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all them good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis, Tennessee know, see, I start to go deep back
In Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowin' in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowin' in the South
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who I'm tryna be like?
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
Soon as I realize that turnin' papers in won't get me paid
And if I don't do nothing, I'ma ball
I'm countin' all day like the clock on the wall, yeah, I need that
Making major changes to the life I'm livin'
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm gettin' back to my ways

47,We’ll Be Fine,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Never thoughts of suicide, I'm too alive
But I still treat it like it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans
But neither was making it, and here I am
In the presidential, do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing movin' through the street
Got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib
Goddamn, man, she's beauty and the beast, Lord
Seem like yesterday that I was up-and-coming
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing
The fam here? The drink here? The girls here?
Well, fuck, let's get it then
[Chorus: Drake]
Uh, I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double? You ain't even gotta ask, ah
Because it's hard to say no (Say no)
Yeah, it gets hard to say no
Are you down? Are you down? Yeah, you all the way down
Every time (Every time, every time, every time)
Am I down? Am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down
We'll be fine (We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine)
Are you down? Are you down? Yeah, you all the way down
Every time (Every time, every time, every time)
Am I down? Am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down
We'll be fine (We'll be fine, we'll be fine, we'll be fine)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah
Used to make us proud, we had dreams of getting bigger, man
Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga, man, uh
You keep talking how you was this and you had this
And you deserve some fuckin' credit, how did anyone forget it?
Got a show up in your city, your girl is in the line
And the line around the corner, it's my motherfuckin' time
You should take it as a sign, man, I got it right now
I wouldn't doubt it, 'cause these bitches all about it right now
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She says, ""You're such a dog,"" I say, ""You're such a bone""
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days, women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention, though, they always saying, ""Show me some""
But girl, you ain't the only one that's tryna be the only one, uh
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that
Then, fuck, let's get it then

48,Make Me Proud,"[Verse 1: Drake]
I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it'll make the shit last
Don't make it too easy, girl, don't take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there, that's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still wet 'cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale, but you probably went to Howard, knowing you
Weekend in Miami, tryna study by the pool
Couple things due, but you always get it done
Might've been a time where I loved her too
But you take that away and you've always been the one, one
I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it's just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in they life as a wife
That's why you wanna have no sex, why you wanna protest
Why you wanna fight for your right
'Cause you don't love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise
[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wonderin' what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these motherfuckers wanna waste your time
It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so proud of you
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you—

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I'm badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I'm straddling
And my shit's so wet, you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row your boat
It's Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest still
The best legal team, so the deals is ill
It's MAC, OPI, and a fragrance too
Apparel, I'm dominatin' every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
'Cause I'm fl-fl-fly, I'm flyin' high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch
But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say
Could be a million, billion, trillion miles away
He asked my sign, I said a Sag'
I'm a star, sheriff badge
What's the point if I'm guardin'?
Double-D up, hoes, Dolly Parton

And I know the sun will rise with me (Huh)
And I know the sun will rise with me (All we wanted was an opportunity)
Just Blaze (Lord knows)

[Verse 1: Drake & Rick Ross]
It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all
But that's just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that I'm ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Haffa and Jordan my only role models
That's why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas, they want no problems
Bought 'em sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it's whatever if somebody won't make it a thing
I'm more concerned with niggas thinkin' 'bout Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake, a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields, they makin' the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I'm working overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit, record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team
Matchin' Rollies for real, matchin' Rovers for real (Woo)
Places they say they've been, we actually goin' for real (Woo)
I'm really killin' shit, fuck all the jiggy rappin' (Woo)
I'm going trigger happy just to see my niggas happy
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things (Huh)
With my new bitch that's livin' in Palm Springs
Young-ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
In a time where it's recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin' fun at
Never the flow, though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I changed rap forever, the game back together, yeah
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I'm a descendant of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven't figured it out 'cause my story is far from finished
I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy
Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson, boost the rate up, it's time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin' spooky
Very, very scary like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch, all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That's why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real
[Interlude: Rick Ross]
Huh
You know I love this
YOLO, you only live once
I'm going so hard, my nigga
I swear, homie
Every day is another opportunity to reach that goal
(M-M-Maybach Music)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I fell in love with the pen, started fuckin' the ink (Huh)
The hustle's an art, I painted what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica (Woo)
Villa on the water with the wonderful views
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews
Went and got a yacht, I'm talkin' Carnival Cruise
And these niggas talkin' like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
It's the red bottom boss (Huh), came to buy the bar (Huh)
Every bi-week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car (Woo)
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double-R (Woo)
Headlights flickin', lookin' like a falling star
Every day, them hammers bang, whippin' yay like Anna Mae
I run the game, but the ladies think I'm runnin' game
Mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate

So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long

But don't you go getting married

Can't lose you, can't help it

52,Doing It Wrong,"[Verse 1]
When a good thing goes bad, it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

[Chorus]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
'Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say, ""I love you too""
[Refrain]
But I need someone different
You know it, oh, you know it
Oh, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh, you know it
Oh, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh, she knows it
Oh, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
We live in a generation of not being in love and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
'Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else

[Chorus]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you

53,The Real Her,"[Verse 1: Drake]
People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekend's here, started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing, ooh

Houston girls love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down

Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time

They keep telling me don't save you
If I ignore all that advice, then something isn't right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right
Even if I only get part of it right

Party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too
There's things we might discover

We're perfect for each other

54,Look What You’ve Done,"[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
Man

[Verse 1]
It's like '09 in your basement and I'm in love with Nebby
And I still love her, but it fell through because I wasn't ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt and you smokin' heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ash it, and we argue about spendin' money on bullshit
And you tell me I'm just like my father, my one button, you push it
Now it's fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat
And I leave out and you call me and you tell me that you sorry
And you love me and I love you and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep, but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard if you were healthy and it weren't so bad, uh
Maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
'Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbin' a bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh, it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinkin' of signin' me, I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son, man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
And get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we should've known
'Cause you deserve it
[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now, yeah
You knew that I was gon' be somethin'
When you're stressed out and you need somethin', I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've, look what you've
[Verse 2]
It's like '06 in your backyard, I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love 'cause when it's that real is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid, damn
Boohoo, sad story, Black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid, but it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you, man, this all new shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fightin' going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting
Now I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'd be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, then you got to me
Then you'd toss the keys and loan me your car, yeah
Just a young kid in a drop-top Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life so worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything
You said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced, but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where I'd really be without that
It worked out, man, you deserve it

Gotta do what I gotta do
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 1: Drake]
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ""hello"" or a ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after, texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer?
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fuckin' with ya, damn
Is it the fall? Time for me to revisit the past
There's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all, damn
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like
[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fuck your girl, is it true?
You gettin' money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, so much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessin'
And started undressin' and asked me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure, damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like

And the girl you fuckin' hates you and your friends faded off shots of
What you ordered to forget about the game that you on top of
Your famous girlfriend ass keep gettin' thicker than the plot does
And when you forget her, that's when she pop up
And you got a drop, but you ride around with the top up
Or get three SUVs for niggas dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley
Scallops and glasses of Dolce, that shit right up your alley
Yeah, you see a girl and you ask about her
Bitches smiling at you, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
It's feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through airport security with your hat down

And tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished
And steal your mother's debit card so you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted
You need a minute? You got it
You know it's real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
Apartment 1503, some couches and paintings
Where you record with two others that want the same things
Yeah, it start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night, you swear you gettin' close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But shit, you 'bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs in hopes that you could be the nigga
And come out every night to let the city see they nigga
Tellin' stories that nobody relate to

I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbin' hard, fuckin' women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up on Biscayne
Still gettin' brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?
Twenty-five, sitting on twenty-five mil', uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'ma do it for the Bay, okay
Gettin' paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune light one, pass it like a relay
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J, and Chubbs, shout to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
Aww, that's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
'Cause the pimpin' ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't, then again, maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?
[Chorus: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once, that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we 'bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em 'cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

59,Hate Sleeping Alone,"[Verse 1]
She says, ""Kiss me like you miss me
Fuck me like you hate me
And when you're fuckin' someone else
Just fuck her like she ain't me""
Damn, those words are scary
Those words are scary, Virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love two years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It's all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don't I?
I get off-topic, don't I? I get it poppin', don't I?
I'll end up stoppin', won't I?
And by the time I end up stoppin'
You'll be rockin' one of the rings that you pointed out while shoppin' with a nigga, don't lie
Uh, she's losin' it right now
'Cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been movin' in by now
But instead we're movin' slow, I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusin' it right now
But this money comin' in is just confusin' shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit, I guess I'm provin' it right now, oh
[Chorus]
I say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they'd be down
'Cause I hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
Half the time, we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
So she's here and we're both so gone

[Verse 2]
Hotel to hotel, girl, I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight and you come to me
But she don't want a weekend, she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me, then she says she done with me
You say that you're over me, you always end up under me
You know how it goes, don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with your shit, I put you back in your place
She tells me, ""I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face""
And hangs up, yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you?
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with too?
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make, I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn, I guess I'm proving it right now, oh
","
she says kiss me like you miss me
fuck me like you hate me
and when youre fuckin someone else
just fuck her like she aint me
damn those words are scary

Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura

Still gettin' brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?

Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin' on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

61,Tuscan Leather,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
Alright, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Comin' off the last record
I'm gettin' twenty million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga, that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
'Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga
Rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
Yeah, I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
'Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self-explanatory, you just here to spread the story
Wassup?
[Verse 2: Drake]
Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money, nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission, tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like ayy, B, I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real

[Verse 3: Drake]
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote, we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna (Talk to 'em)
The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these nineties fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like ""Fuck it"", like ""YOLO""
Wanted to tell you, ""Accept yourself""
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me
Now real nigga, wassup?
Ayy, yeah, ayy
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?

62,Furthest Thing,"[Verse 1]
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl, I always stay down
Get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in, they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same
[Chorus]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know

Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know

[Verse 2]
And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl, don't treat me like a stranger, girl, you know I seen you naked
Girl, you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin', girl, and you might feel like nothin' was the same

I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low

You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me
Baby, it's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing

And nowadays when I ask about who got it
They say it's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody

Who you like, baby, who you like?

Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like ""Preach""
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there 'cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried 'cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life, and this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Yeah, paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

start to become a distant memory
things change in that life and this life started lacking synergy
and fuckin with me mentally i think its meant to be
yeah paranoid always rolling with my mothafuckin boys
but you gotta understand when its yours
they dont really leave your ass with a mothafuckin choice man

65,Own It,"[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Own it
It's yours
It's yours

[Verse 1: Drake & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Yours
You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? (Yours)
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall, I wanna be standin' for you
And next time I spend, I want it all to be for you, oh
Peakin', I'm peakin'
Wake up with me this weekend, we can, oh
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?

Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a ""sorry"" (How you do?)
Couple bitches tryna have me on the Maury
Like nigga, it's yours, you should be supportin'
But where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl
You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl
'Cause you got the Batphone and my work line
You should call
When the last time you did somethin' for the first time?
You done done it all
I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days, but oh (Yeah)

67,From Time,"[Verse 1: Jhené Aiko]
What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that
'Cause

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love
[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl, that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the seventies on your own
My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is
""Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone?""
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

""There's three balls and a strike
Here's the pitch
It's belted deep to center
Revere goes back, jumps at the wall, and it's gone!""

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, isn't it amazing
How you talk all this shit and we still lack communication?
How beautiful our kids would be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with, ""This time will be different""
Oh, oh, the idea is fun
Oh, the idea is fun
Oh, the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for home run every time
[Chorus: Drake]
Swanging, eyes closed, just swanging
Same city, same friends, if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends, if you're looking
I'll be here, just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume, 'cause I don't respect assumptions, babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin', babe
Yeah, swanging

[Verse 2: Drake]
Ayy
She just wanna run around the city
And make memories that she can barely remember
And I'd allow her
Talk about pussy power (Yeah)
She just wanna run over my feelings
Like she drinking and driving in a eighteen-wheeler
And I'd allow her
Talk about pussy power
She used to say, ""You can be whoever you want, even yourself""
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was
And never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Wish you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around

Fuck any nigga that's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum, I look at my wrist and it's already platinum

I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you

I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny
You don't even know 'bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl
She been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer

72,Too Much,"[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oh, don't think about—)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls
And they end up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a pot luck, you need to come with it, don't run from it
Like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it one hundred
Met a lot of girls in my times there
Word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year
Man, I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like, ""Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin'
'Fore I show up there and there's no one there?""
These days, I could probably pack it
For like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, ""Take a deep breath
You're too worried about being the best out""
[Chorus: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much

(Oh, don't think about—)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, ""Oh, well, this is life, I guess""
Nah, fuck that shit
Listen, man, you can still do what you wanna do
You gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign
That's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
I hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment
Telling herself that she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit
Like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round
Started treating me like I'm ""him"" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together
We just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down
Pick the pen up or put the pen down?
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen-pal
But we've been down

73,Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2,"[Part I: Pound Cake]
[Spoken Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty—like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know, whether it's disco and rock
But, uh, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had the champagne in the studio, of course
You know, compliments of the company
And we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you
Because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow
[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik

Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill, y'all (Y'all, y'all)

Frikki-frikki-frikki, dollar-dollar-dollar bill, y'all (Y'all, y'all)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah
Uh, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin', dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

74,Come Thru,"[Intro]
Yeah
We had the type of nights where mornin' comes too soon
And nothin' was the same

[Verse 1]
Watch me, goin' out of the way, when I shoulda went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, prolly put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn somethin'
[Chorus]
Come through, come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through
Know ya got that thang that I like
Know ya, know ya got that thang that I like
Come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through

[Verse 2]
Yeah, last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
It's supposed to be a lot of hard workin' goin' on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' goin' on?
Someone put a order in for a chicken (for a chicken)
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen (need the kitchen)
Yeah, they know I got the hookup, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby, I heat up the stove, you do the dishes, ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different, ya know?
Last album had it boomin' somethin' vicious, ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl, ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl, you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn somethin'

75,All Me,"[Produced by KeY Wane]
[Intro: Aziz Ansari]
I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free, Randy

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (yeah)
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (2 Chainz)
No help, that's all me, all me for real
[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring, dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line""
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!""
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga, God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Tru)

[Chorus: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

76,The Motion,"[Intro: Drake & Sampha]
It's not me and you, it's not me it's you
You're reckless and you know it, they don't love you like I do
Say you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

[Verse 1: Drake]
I don't have a fuck to give, I've been moving state to state
In my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the Eastside of the city, that's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling 'cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from you, man, they don't leave you alone
But I guess that's just the motion, yeah
[Chorus 1: Drake, Drake & Sampha, Sampha]
Then that phone doesn't ring
When they got everything, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, looking back on it, at least my pride is intact
'Cause we said ""no strings attached"" and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus 2: Drake, Drake & Sampha]
She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
[Outro: Drake, Sampha]
Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor
I guess that's just the motion
Talking to you is not enough, no
I guess that’s just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

77,Keep the Family Close,"[Intro]
It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

[Chorus]
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
[Verse 1]
Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now we're meeting our end

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 2]
You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A., I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on

Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, man the whole city
Shit's crazy right now, and shit ain't gonna stop
Know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better

[Verse 1]
Look, mama hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it

(Dying, woo, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, woo, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)

(Dying, woo, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)

[Verse 2]
All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'ma start telling niggas ""Get it how you can""
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night, I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5  for it
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it

On some DMX shit

And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?

How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You sent a ""Are you here?"" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal

Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose

Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way

Man don't live of a di hype huh?
Real ting ay
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Okay now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But on verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see RiRi right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me
[Chorus: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

[Verse 2: Drake]
I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

to make sure the money was right
they love to talk
me im just dunning the hype
me im just dunning the hype
me im just done done done done done

verse 2 drake
i dont take this shit for granted
i do my own propaganda
i feel like juelz santana
leg hangin out the phantom
6 cold like alaska
views already a classic
roy outta here like nasa
bustin 1s out the plastic
her gram too poppin to fuck her
the chain too heavy to tuck it im serious
i feed my family with this
so dont play with my money this summer im serious
i dont run out of material
you shouldnt speak on me period
you try to give em your side of the story
they heard it but they wasnt hearin it
they feeling a way and wont hide it
niggas done being silent
dont get along man we tried it
whats the point of even tryin
i hate a goofy especially
they always dyin to mention me
they gotta go they gotta go
they gotta die out eventually
i cannot give em no empathy
ima have bs when im 70
they cannot fuck with the legacy
i dont know what else is left for me
after this no one a threat to me
my enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
i dont let it get to me

82,Weston Road Flows,"[Intro]
One of dem ones—right

[Verse]
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it
He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, ""What are those?""
I mean, you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places
Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care, no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk in collecting
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect
You don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers
On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk at the corner store is I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain’t always how it seems when it’s sewn together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you
Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter
Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want
[Outro]
Yeah, that's right, yeah","

Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
“It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait”
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm gettin' straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute
[Verse 2]
Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think runnin' this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room
Payment plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either

Who do you really love? Well, that's sure to be in question
My Mount Rushmore is me with four different expressions
Who's givin' out this much return on investment?
After my run, man, how is that even a question?
After this summer, man, how is that even a—
I've had real Philly niggas try to write my endin'
Takin' shots with the GOAT and talked about shots that we sendin'
I've had scuffles with bad boys that wasn't pretendin'
I've had too many nights to mention, that's just the beginnin'
I'm pretty sure we got a label, I'm still independent
I fell back a hundred times when I don't get the credit
Seen this movie a hundred times, I know where it's headed
Realize someone gotta die when no one'll dead it

I have tea with the stars and I swim with the sharks
And I see in the dark, wasn't this cold at the start
Think my soul has been marked, there's a hole in my heart
Yeah, I was about to— Man, I thought about it
It's unsettlin' to talk about it
Free all of my niggas that they caught with it
RIP my niggas that they caught without it
This just the intro, let me not get ahead of myself
This is God's plan, young man, you said it yourself
Always got a ace up my sleeve for whatever was dealt
Daddy got suits like Bernie Mac, he dresses himself
I stopped askin' myself and I started feelin' myself
Now I gotta deal with all this drama and deal with myself
I ain't even have to cut the tie, it severed itself
This just the intro, let me not get ahead of myself","
i been waitin on this
yeah

verse
all of this disorder no addressin
the crown is broken in pieces but theres more in my possession
theres a whole lot in my possession
who do you really love well thats sure to be in question
my mount rushmore is me with four different expressions
whos givin out this much return on investment
after my run man how is that even a question
after this summer man how is that even a—
ive had real philly niggas try to write my endin
takin shots with the goat and talked about shots that we sendin
ive had scuffles with bad boys that wasnt pretendin
ive had too many nights to mention thats just the beginnin
im pretty sure we got a label im still independent
i fell back a hundred times when i dont get the credit
seen this movie a hundred times i know where its headed
realize someone gotta die when no onell dead it
niggas gamblin with they life for some content
thats the type of lottery that could get your top picked
i am a creamofthecrop nigga
you niggas pop mollies my malis pop niggas
house on both coasts but i live on the charts
i have tea with the stars and i swim with the sharks
and i see in the dark wasnt this cold at the start
think my soul has been marked theres a hole in my heart
yeah i was about to— man i thought about it
its unsettlin to talk about it
free all of my niggas that they caught with it
rip my niggas that they caught without it
this just the intro let me not get ahead of myself
this is gods plan young man you said it yourself
always got a ace up my sleeve for whatever was dealt
daddy got suits like bernie mac he dresses himself
i stopped askin myself and i started feelin myself
now i gotta deal with all this drama and deal with myself
i aint even have to cut the tie it severed itself
this just the intro let me not get ahead of myself"

Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, I just flipped a switch (Flipped, flipped)
I don't know nobody else that's doin' this
Bodies start to drop, ayy (Hit the floor)
Now they wanna know me since I hit the top, ayy
This a Rollie, not a stopwatch, shit don't ever stop
This the flow that got the block hot, shit got super hot, ayy
Give me my respect (Give me my respect)
I just took it left like I'm ambidex'
Bitch, I move through London with the Eurostep (Two)
Got a sneaker deal and I ain't break a sweat
Catch me 'cause I'm gone (Outta there, I’m gone)
How I go from 6 to 23 like I'm LeBron?
Servin' up a pack (Servin' up a pack)
Niggas pullin' gimmicks 'cause they scared to rap, ayy
Funny how they shook, ayy, got these niggas shook
Pullin' back the curtain by myself, take a look, ayy
I'm a bar spitta, I’m a hard hitta
Yeah I’m light-skinned, but I'm still a dark nigga
I'm a wig splitta, I'm a tall figure
I'm an unforgivin' wild-ass dog nigga
Somethin' wrong with 'em, got 'em all bitter
I'm a bill printer, I'm a gravedigger
Yeah, I am what I am
I don't have no time for no misunderstandings again

Future took the business and ran it for me
I let Ollie take the owl, told him brand it for me
I get 2 million a pop and that’s standard for me
Like I went blind, dog, you gotta hand it to me
(Gotta gimme that shit, dog)
Prayed, then I prayed again (Amen, Lord)
Had a moment but it came and went
(They don't love you no more)
You don’t wanna play with him (Nah, nah, nah)
They’ll be mournin' you like 8AM (R.I.P.)
Pinky ring 'til I get a wedding ring (Whoa, yeah)
Love my brothers, cut 'em in on anything (Big slice)
And you know it's King Slime Drizzy, damn (Woo yeah)
She just said I'm bae, I hit the thizzle dance (Mac Dre shit)
Either hand is the upper hand (Oh yeah, shit)
Got a bubba on my other hand (Whoa, yeah, shit, yeah)
This shit ain't no hundred bands (Nah, nah, nah, nah)
Palace look like Buckingham
Bills so big, I call 'em Williams, for real
Reasons to go crazy, got a trillion, for real
They been tryin' me but I'm resilient, for real
I can’t go in public like civilian, for real
And I hardly take offense
Money for revenge, man, that’s hardly an expense
Al Haymon checks off of all of my events
I like all the profit, man, I hardly do percents (I don't do that shit)
A big part of me resents
Niggas that I knew from when I started in this shit
They see what I got and, man, it's hard to be content
Fuck what they got goin' on, I gotta represent (Ayy!)

You know what is on my mind, all I think about is hunnids
I stay busy (Bzz!) workin' on me
I stay busy with my business, homie
I already hit her when you left her lonely
She is not the type that likes to take things slowly
Slowly, my mouth is goin' off, I don't know patience
I got a chance then my niggas got it too like it's contagious
I see the future when I get wavy (Wavy God!)
But I couldn't picture bein' Champagne (Haan) when I would buy that shit and save it for the right occasion
I couldn't picture changes
When I was with Ms. Creighton, that lady hates me
Couldn't picture wifin' Braden when I was pumpin' gas on road trips to go from Cincinnati on to Dayton
I couldn't gauge it
I wanna thank God for workin' way harder than Satan
He's playin' favourites, it feels amazin' (Yeah)

100,Emotionless,"[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
You've got me feeling emotions
Ayy, higher
Ah
You've got me fe–
You, oh

[Verse 1: Drake]
Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?
[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
You've got me fe–
You, oh
You've got me fe–
You, oh, ayy

[Verse 2: Drake]
Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is ""Leave me alone""
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, ""Why let the story run if it's false?""
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
Every month

I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991 (One, one, one)

End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex (Ex, ex, ex, ex)

Blast that shit back if you blastin'
Ayy

[Verse 1]
UberX to Hidden Hills
Give me somethin' I can feel
If they come to Hidden Hills
Then I know they know the deal
We just right there up the road
You could hit it with a stone
I be out here on my own
I'm just tryna set the tone
I've been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now
Niggas think they run the town
'Til we run 'em out of town
And they gotta relocate
Gotta dip from where they stay
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way
[Chorus]
Skid around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one
I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know
But they can't take a joke, 'cause it's not one
Think it's 'cause we live by the code, reputation to uphold
Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from
I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a joke

[Interlude]
Ayo, blast that shit, Maxx
Blast that shit back if you blastin'
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Back and forth to Italy
My comment section killin' me
I swear I get so passionate
Y'all do not know the half of it
I grew up with the Reps Up boys, we crashin' it and splashin' in
And when I say they crashin' it, I do not mean a accident
I'm– I'm still in the studio at 6:45
And my haters either on they way to work or they arrived
And I gotta own the things I rap about just for my pride
You know when it comes to pride, I can't put that shit aside
I've been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now
They be throwin' in the towel
I do yellowtail at TAO
They be watchin' what they say
Especially when it's to my face
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way

Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooh, ooh (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Niggas see the crib and ask who did I steal from
Price tags on makin' the world feel some
They don't have enough to satisfy a real one
Maverick Carter couldn't even get the deal done
Niggas scared to come towards us, gotta run from us
Louisville hush money for my young gunners
Rick Pitino, I take 'em to strip clubs and casinos
Stack of C-notes, get all you niggas scratched like Preemo
Worms, I just opened up a can of those
My mother had a flower shop, but I was Sandra's rose
Two girls that I rope like Indiana Jones
I make them hoes walk together like I'm Amber Rose
Yeah, fuck that, I got to up the ante
California girls sweeter than pieces of candy
Had me all in Nipsey hood to go link up with Sammy
Type of hood where bandanas make niggas a family
Head on a swivel, I could shoot but I could never dribble
Life too short, I gotta get it 'fore they blow the whistle
My uncle tryna change my energy with stones and crystals
But it's gon' take more than that for me to control my issues
I wasn't made for no casket or no prison cell
Every title doin' numbers like I'm Miss Adele
Sandra knows I pulled us out of a living hell
I'm the chosen one, flowers never pick themselves
[Chorus]
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
Yeah, no more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Niggas want a classic, that's just ten of these
Crime family like the Genovese, you don't want drama, capisc'?
My house is full of supermodels just like Mohamed Hadid
I take this shit too serious, you niggas my comic relief
I find it funny how I keep on talkin' and commas increase
I'm standin' at the top of where you niggas are climbin' to reach
I even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets
Subtle reminders are key, jeez!
Spoiler alert: the second act is tragic
And everyone that wants the worst for me's askin' what happened
Backstabbed so many times I started walkin' backwards
Like Charlamagne, I see the light and see the darkest patches
Bury me and I'll be born again
I walk in godly form amongst the mortal men
I got some real demons across the border fence
And made a note of the mistakes we can't afford again
Like I said, can of worms and I'm the early bird
Niggas want to hang but I'm too busy doin' dirty work
Hit 'em back and say we'll link up on the 33rd
When I say that they cursin' me, it ain't dirty words
Church of Pentecost, Holy Spirit synagogue
I don't know who's protectin' me but we hit it off
Sandra's rose, no wonder they tryna pick me off
I guess you gotta show these niggas who you really are

Ayy, ayy
Lot of 6's in here tonight
Yeah, yeah, ayy
(Dopeman!)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ten of us, we movin' as one
I'm so proud of who I've become
You might think I've taken some lumps
Only if we talkin' 'bout sums (Yeah)
Intentions are pure, they cannot tell me relax
My mentions are jokes, but they never give me the facts
This isn't that, can't be ignorin' the stats
Based off of that, they gotta run me the max
They gotta run me the max, they gotta double the racks
They had it set up for real, but they didn't come with the slaps
When I heard the shit I was skippin' through that
If I get it trippin', it's no comin' back
I don't understand, these niggas gotta adapt
You know where I'm at, I put the 6 on the map
Your shorty was bent, she wanted to vent
I promise it fell in my lap
My money is young, my problems are old
I promise I'm bridgin' the gap
[Chorus: Drake]
Woo! You know what I'm sayin'?
Woo! Ayy, ayy
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
(Gyeah, gyeah, gyeah, gyeah!)

[Refrain: Drake]
Niggas provoke, this shit ain't a joke, man, nobody playin'
He's at the top and he's at the top, but nobody stayin'
These niggas around but they ain't around
You know what I'm sayin'?
Say that they down, when they shit is down
You know what I'm sayin'?

Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
Ayy, ayy, yeah
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Yo, get close enough to HOV, smell like a kilo still (Still)
First album 26, I ain't need no deal (Real)
Already a hood legend, I ain't need no Shyne (Woo!)
First Rollie flooded out, I ain't see no time, woah
Stand-up niggas, we only duckin' indictments
Dope boys, Off-White, lookin' like soft white on 'em
Heh, you know what I'm sayin'?
We in the buildin', we came for a billion, ain't nobody playin'
Live every word that I'm rappin'
Say I lost 90 bricks and it happened
You probably wouldn't believe
Everything that you seein' right now if it wasn't live action
I ain't on the 'Gram, they record who I am
God to these dope boys, how do you not be a HOV fan?
I'm what Meech shoulda been
I'm what Supreme didn't become
If Alpo didn't snitch, niggas'd be like Young
I got your President tweetin', I won't even meet with him
Y'all killed X and let Zimmerman live, shhh, s-streets is done

108,Is There More,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Only holdin' up I do is my end of the bargain
Only beggin' that I do is me beggin' your pardon
Only tryin' that I do is me tryin' the hardest
Only problems I do are math problems with profit
Only lyin' I do is lyin' out in the tropics
Only cryin' I do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it
Only lackin' I can do is my lack of responses
Only rest that I do is ""Where the rest of my commas?""
Still I rise, Maya Angelou vibes
When life comin' at you from all angles and sides
And they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside
It really boils down to how you plan to survive
Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em
Give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em?
Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom
And they recognize the bathroom
All hell starts to break loose in my texts
I only tell lies to who I gotta protect
I would rather have you remember me how we met
I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect
But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step
That ain't what I'm 'bout
I'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt
If I can't make it with you, I'll make it without
They say take the good with the bad, I'll take it without
Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house
My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the South
Is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts?
Is there more to life than sayin' I figured it out?
Is there more? Yeah
[Verse 2: Drake]
Sweeter the berry, the blacker the juice
The boy is back in the booth, ready to tap into truth
Too many lyrics 'bout houses and loot
Too many Walt Disney characters, mouses and goofs
I mean you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who?
I'll let you bring a thousand recruits
My peers are a talented group
But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two
Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops
There's still nothin' they could really do
It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due
Whenever it's time to recoup
Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal
In the house playin' D'Angelo, ""How Does It Feel?""
I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die
What you got, time on your hands or time on your side?
Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high?
Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai?
Yachts on the 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies
Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties
And all of these fortunate times
And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size?
Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find?
Like healin' my soul, like family time
Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive?
Is there more?

I think you're changing your mind
Starting to see it in your eyes
I used to love a good surprise
And now, I'd rather know ahead of time

You said ""I love you"" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done
[Verse 1]
Yeah, you say I led you on, but you followed me
I follow one of your friends, you unfollow me
Then you block them so they can't see
You liking someone just like me
I expected more from you honestly
Said you want a simple life and that's not me
How you go from that to endin' up with someone just like…?

[Pre-Chorus]
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezing outside
You're confusin' me
Don't have me wastin' my time

Yeah, you said ""I love you"" too fast
So much for that, girl
Summer just started, and we're already done

I kept you sane, I kept it peaceful, don't lie
I kept it decent

Dragged me like two hours to your family's house, for what?
Said you need some time but I should stick around, for what?
Always felt like stickin' 'round's the same as being stuck
And like guns with the ink in, you're gettin' under my skin
Pretty little young thing (Young thing)
Had a nigga convinced, got me too excited
Yeah, you played me, you played me, you played me
Lowdown, dirty, shameful, crazy
I need to know how the new nigga you got does the same thing
I do for a living but is way less wavy
How you even managin' to keep straight faces?
In all the pictures that I seen lately
Lord knows you still look amazin'
That's besides the point I'm makin'
You're way too opinionated to have to force it, to have to fake it
You had potential, I coulda shaped it
You went and caved in (Ooh, yeah)
We coulda waited, I wasn't rushin', difference in ages
You're old enough, but you're still a baby
You've shared stories where you did amazin'
Things to be loyal, things to be patient
That was before me, I musta changed it
Shifted your focus, lens lookin' jaded (Jaded)

yeah you played me you played me you played me
lowdown dirty shameful crazy
i need to know how the new nigga you got does the same thing
i do for a living but is way less wavy
how you even managin to keep straight faces
in all the pictures that i seen lately
lord knows you still look amazin
thats besides the point im makin
youre way too opinionated to have to force it to have to fake it
you had potential i coulda shaped it
you went and caved in ooh yeah
we coulda waited i wasnt rushin difference in ages
youre old enough but youre still a baby
youve shared stories where you did amazin
things to be loyal things to be patient
that was before me i musta changed it
shifted your focus lens lookin jaded jaded

Assuming the worst 'cause I haven't heard from you all weekend
Your silence is drivin' me up the wall, up the wall
I cannot tell if you're duckin' calls or missin' calls
'Cause you've been so patient
I drink on the job and smoke on the job
So, I don't know how serious you take it
Can't offer much more, you've heard it before

Get the vibe right, get your mind right

Put your feet in this water, don't wanna get your hair wet
We've hooked up a couple times, we ain't took it there yet
You broke up with your man and ain't been with nobody else
You like, ""Fuck these niggas,"" rather keep it to yourself
He did you wrong, he left you down bad
Now you can't trust nobody
You said, ""Do anything, but just don't lie to me""

Yeah, I never really
Talk about dick that I wanna give you or places I wanna get to
Neck grab, hair grab
Arch back, heart attack, cardiac
I need it nasty like, like Evil Angel, like Vivid
You know, nasty like how they give it
You know, I need you to be open like Kai's kitchen
That pussy kinda sound like waves hittin' (Kshh!)
Soothin', keep it right there, no movin'
Make my way around the bases-es
I wanna take you to oasises
Bein' honest, I don't really know what patience is
Ayy, freaky like the red leather Michael
Zombie revival, this ain't like you
This that new you, this ain't high school (Hi)
I like best when you're fresh faced and no foundation
Willin' and ready for the takin'
Earth-shatterin', groundbreakin'
Headscarf for after our relations
No judgment is our arrangement
Make that face up if you dare
But just be prepared that I am gonna cause that lipstick to smear
And the mascara tears to run down
I always need a glass of wine by sundown
I always get your ass over here somehow
I hope that the apocalypse is the only thing that doesn't come now, we’re one now

121,March 14,"[Intro]
Here we go
Yeah

[Verse]
Yesterday morning was crazy
I had to come to terms with the fact that it's not a maybe
That shit is in stone, sealed and signed
She not my lover like ""Billie Jean"", but the kid is mine
Sandi used to tell me all it takes is one time, and all it took was one time
Shit, we only met two times, two times
And both times were nothin' like the new times
Now it's rough times, I'm out here on front lines
Just tryin' to make sure that I see him sometimes
It's breakin' my spirit
Single father, I hate when I hear it
I used to challenge my parents on every album
Now I'm embarrassed to tell 'em I ended up as a co-parent
Always promised the family unit
I wanted it to be different because I've been through it
But this is the harsh truth now
And fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now
I don't want you worry 'bout whose house
You live at, or who loves you more or who's not there
Who did what to who 'fore you got here
Nah, look, I'm too proud to let that come between me and you now
Realize I gotta think for two now
I gotta make it, I better make it
I promise if I'm not dead, then I'm dedicated
This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated
I can't forget the looks on they faces
Got the news in Miami that now we all got ones that we raisin'
Tell Gelo bring some Mod Rosé and the Baccarats out
For our cheers to the next generation
But this Champagne toast is short-lived
I got an empty crib in my empty crib
I only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick
I think he must've brought you like twenty gifts
Your mother say you growin' so fast that they don't even really fit
But man, you know
I still had to get it for my boy though, you know
You haven't met your grandfather yet, that nigga a trip
He probably could'a did stand-up
Yeah, but at the same time, he's a stand up
And that's how you gon' be when it's time to man up
October baby for irony's sake, of course
I got this 11 tatted for somebody, now it's yours
And believe me, I can't wait to get a hundred more
Sorry I'm ventin', tryna cover ground
They said that in two weeks, you're supposed to come in town
Hopefully by the time you hear this
Me and your mother will have come around
Instead of always cuttin' each other down
God willin', I got a good feelin'
You got a good spirit
We'll talk more when you hear this, my G
[Outro]
I'm changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
I'm all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain, to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
Here we go again","

122,Champagne Poetry,"[Part I]

[Intro]
I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I, until I
I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I find a
Say the only words I know that you'll

[Verse 1]
I been hot since the birth of my son
I remain unfazed, trust, worse has been done
Man, fuck a valuation, show me personal funds
It's the pretty boys versus the petty boys
Sold that already, got a whole new set of toys
Shit is so surreal, Drizzy Drake, you better enjoy it
Nothing else bigger than the OVO letterman boys
Cashmere knits for the nighttime boat rides
Ollie got the first еdition parked up roadside
The only sign of strugglin' is coming from thosе guys
I'm tryna just relay what I can see through my own eyes
And nothin' tell the truth like the eyes will
Lived so much for others don't remember how I feel
Friends in high places and friends that are high still
Still managed to moonwalk straight through a minefield
And then I'll come back to tell you how that feels
Built this house for us all, pain in my back still
You niggas gassed up, you couldn't pay the
[Interlude]
I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I, until I
I love you, I love you, I love you
Until I find a
Say the only words I know that you'll

[Verse 2]
Champagne poetry, these are the effortless flows, supposedly
Something else is controlling me
Under her pictures live some of the greatest quotes from me
Under me, I see all the people that claim they over me
And above me, I see nobody
I'd have to be dead for them to say that you took it from me
The twenty percent of you that we own is my tootsie's money
Nigga, I'm wilding with your bread, you owe it to me
CJ grab racks out the bag and throw it to me
They don't want a problem with the boy, but it's goin' to be
Trust in my brothers is as strong as I know it should be
Future sign the contracts, he don't even show it to me
I don't have to second-guess nothing with no one I love
'Bout to build a second guest house 'cause we growing too much
Think I got to scale the love back 'cause

[Interlude]
I need you, I need you, I need you
I need to make you see
What you mean to me
Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean

123,Papi’s Home,"[Intro: Drake & Montell Jordan]
I know that I hurt you
Yeah
I was a child trying to be a man
To all my sons worldwide
I walked out on my only son
All my juniors
I left you in your mother's hands
I apologize for my absence, I know I left you without an annual drop
And now I'm standing right here
I don't know how I expected you to get your clout up and get your money up, but
With tears, with tears streaming from my eyes
Don't worry
See your mother raised a fine young man
Daddy's home
And I know I missed so much of your life
Turn me up (Mario)
[Verse: Drake]
Yeah
Niggas know they need to stop
I'm standing at the top, that's how I know you never seen the top
Sierra Canyon parking lot lookin' like Magic City parking lot
Hear the talks when I walk by like you know it's over when we drop
Ayy, drop
Yeah, and I'm coming with the wop
Y'all niggas not poppin'
Fuck her, then she goin' shoppin'
Woah, I'm runnin' out of opps
They're runnin' out of options
Put 'em up for adoption
Sign my name on the dot
Ayy, this is not luck, baby, this no four-leaf, no horseshoe
I'm in the bank thinkin', ""Poor you""
I'm in New York goin' Jon Chetrit
Supermodels and they all sexy
Lock the door to the bathroom 'cause they doin' something that is not Pepsi
I'm just pourin' up the shots
I remember that I told you I miss you, that was kinda like a mass text
I remember that I told I loved you, that was really in the past tense
I remember that I told you I get you, truth is that I get around
Mentioned havin' us a kid, '42 hit, I tend to kid around
Yeah, on Benedict with the top down
Shorties out here gettin' knocked down
City coming off a lockdown
Rap niggas doing weak features for a pop artist 'cause they popped down
Used to wanna throw the Roc up, niggas know how I rock now

Okay, okay, okay
Countin' up my bodies, damn, the thing just start to pile
Judge me how you judge me, take them bitches out to trial
Fucked a hundred niggas, how them niggas love you now?
You don't know love, you don't love me like my child
Lay your ass down, then that liquor get you fired up
Turn up every day, girl, it don't say that in the Bible
Can't give it up 'cause you love the lifestyle

Told the girls to meet at Tao
Now y'all doin' shots, now them bitches got you fired up
Don't know who you talking 'bout, I'll put that on the Bible
Turnin' up on me, don't make me turn it back around
And you know
Think I'm Tiger Woods, the way I'm teed off thе 17
And you know pockets on whatever, jеans forever green
And you know, told me lotta things, but ain't say everything
But now I know every single thing, there was plenty things I didn't know
Plenty things you didn't say, was fuckin' with you anyway
Was fuckin' with you way before you had some confessions to make
You decide to take it to the grave, I know you gon' take it

Never had a lot, this is all I need

Loyalty is priceless and it's all I need
Can't burn a bridge just to light my way

If it comes down, it's gon' fall on me

Long way down from the heights I'm chasin'
Just touched down, I was lights out in Vegas
Girls checkin' in 'cause my lifestyle dangerous
Hard to tell people that I'm all out of favors
Call me for songs or they call me for paper
Turnin' off my phone for the night now, baby
Pourin' out my soul and it might sound crazy
Some of my niggas don't love me
We should sit down before shit turns ugly
We should sit down since you said things about me

Feelin' young but they treat me like the OG
And they want the tea on me, I swear these bitches nosey
Said he put some money on my head, I guess we gon' see
I won't put no money on his head, my niggas owe me
I gotta be single for a while, you can't control me
Uno, dos, tres, in a race, they can't hold me
And I show my face in a case so you know it's me
Imitation isn't flattery, it's just annoyin' me

And the dirt that they threw on my name
Turned to soil and I grew up out it
Time for y'all to figure out what y'all gon' do about it
Big wheels keep rollin', rollin'

I'm outside, twenty-nine, G5, seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
But honestly that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever hurt one and I'm still here
Outside, frontline, Southside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
Honestly that sound like a fair trade to me

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, don't invite me over if you throw another pity party
Lookin' back, it's hard to tell you where I started
I don't know who love me, but I know that it ain't everybody
I can never love her, she a busy body
Baby, if you want me, can't be turnin' up with everybody, nah
Can't be fuckin' on just anybody, yeah
I got feelings for you, that's the thing about it, yeah
You know that it's somethin' when I sing about it, yeah
Mama used to be on disability but gave me this ability
And now she walkin' with her head high and her back straight
I don't think you feelin' me, I'm out here
Bein' everything they said I wouldn't be and couldn't be
I don't know what happened to them guys that said they would be
I said see you at the top and they misunderstood me
I hold no resentment in my heart, that's that maturity
And we don't keep it on us anymore, it's with security

[Verse 1: Drake]
Oh yeah, yeah
Kept the Galleria open 'til ten for you and your friends
You know how I spend in H-O-U-S-T-O-N
I get too crazy, had a little baddina
We stay good friends, we get too wavy
All I know is that when this cup ends, the next one begins
My bae, you know me and you knew me back then
And you know how it goes when I see you again
You know I'm making my way to your ends
And you know I need you to be there for me
[Verse 2: Drake]
You a little Post Oak baby
You a little forty-eight baby
Got a little candy in her pocket
She gon' take off like a—
You already know (Know, know, know, know)
Dirtied up a cup, I'm on the Northside
Text you but I know you probably courtside
No, I got to come and check the whole man, baby, hold tight
I just touched the city with the G-block stainers
And we got it adopted by some fifth ward strangers
You know what it means when I twist these fingers
Me and you been on a first name basis
Why you think I hate it when you talk that Drake shit?
Same reason that you never left me hangin'
Same reason that I tried to make you famous
Same reason that I tried to show you just who I was

[Chorus: Drake]
Outside of the club, outside the things that a man like me does
Outside of the things that would cause you to judge
Outside of the club
Show you just who I was
Outside of the club, outside the things that a man like me does
Outside of the things that would cause you to judge
Outside of the club

131,Pipe Down,"[Intro]
(I'm working on dying)
Said you belong to the streets but the streets belong to me
It's like home to me (She belongs to the streets)
It's like home to me
I tatted your passport up
Now it's lookin' like a arm sleeve
Just know that was all me

[Verse 1]
And when you see Chanel, I wish that's how you saw me
That shit you tell Chanel, I wish that's how you called me
That raw shit, that honesty, yeah
You know I love you more than all them niggas put together
And it's a lot of niggas' trust, I put the list together
And it's a lot just to assume we're meant to be together
You gotta live that shit for real, you can't just say whatever
You could never tell nobody that you held me down
If it was ride or die then you should've been dead right now
[Chorus]
So I don't get how you're yelling at me
How much I gotta spend for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
How deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
All the things I've done up until right now (Right now)
I need a thousand pages just to write it down (Write it down)
Writing down these feelings, it's been overdue (Overdue)
Don't know how many pens it's gonna take to get over you
How much I gotta pen for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
How deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down?

[Verse 2]
Tried to run it back a hundred times
The world is yours, but the city's mine
I can't believe you put it on your mother's life
I can't believe you told me it was ride or die
'Cause you're not here, somehow you're still alive
True enough I know you from the other side
I set my expectations way too high
Yeah, and I would listen to the lies that you would tell all night
Angel eyes, but you've been giving me hell all night
I know the book that you would write is a tell-some, not a tell-all
Just to make sure you well off, you would sell all rights
Why does your ex think we beefin', is that man alright?
That nigga can't even look at me, he fell off twice
And I'm back poppin', I still remember the day I saw you
I was on your ass like back pockets
Niggas love to hate, but what is that stopping?
So much shit I wanted to say, straight to your face
'Cause you're so two-faced, that I don't know which face
You're the reason we'll be going separate ways
You're the reason we cannot communicate
It's not the things you say, it's what you don't say
I'm not in your way, you're in your own way

It's the truth, swear to you
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

My single line of stars in noon
Reflection of the very moon, I do

135,7am On Bridle Path,"[Intro]
Yeah (Go Squad)
Ayy
Look

[Verse]
I wish everyone could tell me exactly what they need from me
The first second they speak to me, I'm not with all the secrecy
Secretly beefin' me behind closed doors
But playin' it peacefully for the streets to see
My nigga, have some decency
Don't move like a puto
Could at least keep it a buck like Antetokounmpo
I made north of the border like Vito Rizzuto
Throwin' parties in Miami, they lovin' us mucho
With the ho ratio, I'm like David Caruso
Thеre's a mad shortage of peoplе givin' me kudos
I been doin' this since T-Pain was pourin' us Nuvo
You tell 'em I run the country, they'll say, ""True, though""
Papi chulo, grippin' culo
And I got the flows niggas steal like boot toes
You boys reachin' new lows
Lettin' me take the rap for that Casper the Ghost shit
While you findin' all of the loopholes
You niggas move too cold
See the watch collection and assume I got time
'Cause of the ruby rose two-tone
Or switch it to the one I call ""R.I.P. Nipsey""
'Cause I swear to God the bezel got sixty of them blue stones
Maybe I'm gettin' too stoned
Calacatta marble for my tombstone
Here lies a nigga that never lied in his new song
Or any of his old songs
They sing them shits like folk songs
Kumbaya, boom-ba-ye
Know the owl stay on me
Bad bitches tryna come through and lay on me
Tryna get the earl grey on me
But I ain't really into talkin' names
Only tee you're getting from me is one for the walk of shame
Heart is on my sleeve and my body is in the hall of fame
High fashion and my life is full of climaxes
And my wishes come true without blowin' eyelashes
Up in 'Bron crib, fishbowl wineglasses
That's how we passin' time
Hundred thousand on the line
At the table prayin' banker shows a natural nine
It never happens half the time
My losing nights are still a vibe
That's the things I accept
You over there in denial, we not neck and neck
It's been a lot of years since we seen you comin' correct
Man, fuck a ""Respectfully,"" I just want my respect
They tried to label me mean, I say what I mean
People that could've stayed on the team
They played in-between
Clouds is hanging over you now, 'cause I'm reigning supreme
Some of these niggas say what they mean, it ain't what it seems
Had to pull my niggas out the mud like I'm trainin' Marines
You niggas hot to them little kids, you ain't famous to me
Told you I'm aimin' straight for the head, not aiming to please
I could give a fuck about who designing your sneakers and tees
Have somebody put you on a Gildan, you play with my seed
Trust me, there's some shit you really gotta come see to believe
That's why your people not believers, they all leavin' ya
That's why you buyin' into the hype that the press feedin' ya
You know the fourth level of jealousy is called media
Isn't that an ironic revelation?
Give that address to your driver, make it your destination
'Stead of just a post out of desperation
This me reachin' the deepest state of my meditation
While you over there tryna impress the nation
Mind's runnin' wild with the speculation
Why the fuck we peacemakin', doin' the explanations
If we just gon' be right back in that bitch without hesitation?
But let me digress on behalf of the association
I'll play it cool with you, then mark a nigga like Copenhagen
See, they gettin' loose with the line like open cages
In the La Ferrari, my emotions racin', dancin' out a condo, ocean bathin'
Niggas textin' ""Bro,"" but we are not of no close relation
I was down to give these niggas credit, but hold the payment
Somehow I'm the greatest in the game, to my own amazement
The greatest in the world, there's no debatin'
You boys 'bout to wheel me to defeat like we rollerbladin'
Far as the Drake era, man, we in the golden ages
Look at the total wages
And look at the heroes fallin' from grace in their older ages
If we talkin' top three, then you been slidin' to third like stolen bases
Toss around Rollies with frozen faces
They used to tell me back in the day, ""Boy, you're going places""
Never understood where I could really take it

its been a lot of years since we seen you comin correct
man fuck a respectfully i just want my respect
they tried to label me mean i say what i mean
people that couldve stayed on the team
they played inbetween
clouds is hanging over you now cause im reigning supreme
some of these niggas say what they mean it aint what it seems
had to pull my niggas out the mud like im trainin marines
you niggas hot to them little kids you aint famous to me
told you im aimin straight for the head not aiming to please
i could give a fuck about who designing your sneakers and tees
have somebody put you on a gildan you play with my seed
trust me theres some shit you really gotta come see to believe
thats why your people not believers they all leavin ya
thats why you buyin into the hype that the press feedin ya
you know the fourth level of jealousy is called media
isnt that an ironic revelation
give that address to your driver make it your destination
stead of just a post out of desperation
this me reachin the deepest state of my meditation
while you over there tryna impress the nation
minds runnin wild with the speculation
why the fuck we peacemakin doin the explanations
if we just gon be right back in that bitch without hesitation
but let me digress on behalf of the association
ill play it cool with you then mark a nigga like copenhagen
see they gettin loose with the line like open cages
in the la ferrari my emotions racin dancin out a condo ocean bathin
niggas textin bro but we are not of no close relation
i was down to give these niggas credit but hold the payment
somehow im the greatest in the game to my own amazement
the greatest in the world theres no debatin
you boys bout to wheel me to defeat like we rollerbladin
far as the drake era man we in the golden ages
look at the total wages
and look at the heroes fallin from grace in their older ages
if we talkin top three then you been slidin to third like stolen bases
toss around rollies with frozen faces
they used to tell me back in the day boy youre going places
never understood where i could really take it
outro

136,Race My Mind,"[Verse 1]
Just hung up the phone and I
Could already tell that you're comin' home intoxicated, ooh
So you better take your time with me
'Cause I remember last time you wouldn't make love to me
Then you fell fast asleep (I hope you niggas sleep)
Wouldn't even talk to me, no
Say— Say I'm so crazy, baby (I'm so crazy)

[Chorus]
I wanted you to race my mind, I got the keys
Please, for me
Since you're comin' home intoxicated, oh
For me, please
I wanted you to race my mind, mind
[Verse 2]
They said you got high as the sky
Up all night just dancin', huh
I hit you like, ""Please come home to me"" (Come home to me)
But you're not understandin', no
You gon' make me beg, make me plead (Plead)
I wanted you to race my mind, I got the keys
I just figured you could make time for me
Since that you're comin' home intoxicated, oh, yeah

[Bridge]
Race my mind, I got the keys, please

[Verse 3]
Picture me rollin' through downtown in a A4
Picture my signature on a pair of some J 4s
Picture me carin' what niggas sayin' on Wi-Fi they don't pay for
Knew I needed love, but I think I value the hate more
To push towards things that I prayed for
Retrograde energy shifts are what I was made for
And don't you dare hit me back with no ""K, sure""
Soon as I tell you that you the one I would wait for
You too saucy, too flossy, you moved in and moved off me
All to be with niggas who just startin' to move bossy
Maybe I just handled you too softly
Them boys got no Kelis in they blood
If your whole heart wasn't in it, I know a piece of it was
Posted that pic you sent me, it wasn't recent enough
How I'm supposed to wife it? You not Ayesha enough
You love getting T'd up
Love showin' the cakes, you know that they eat it up
Love touchin' the road as soon as it's heatin' up
Invited you over, you said that you showin' up
All them spelling mistakes, I know that you drunk as fuck
All them other mistakes, let's let it be what it was
Them niggas just can't understand it
I want you to change my mind, I'm praying you pulling up
Know who you be around, I know that they teaming up
Telling you you better off leavin' me in the dust

Hold me closer in these
Trying times, supposed to be mine
Baby
I need some help just like anyone else
Hold me closer in these
Trying times, open your eyes
Baby
You said you felt something for me (Talk to 'em)
I don't know when
Based on the signals you send
Based on the way you apologized
When you came to see me and then (Then what?)
You had the nеrve to defend (Dеfend what?)
Mistakes that you made at the end
You said I was too invested
And that's what had forced you to go and pretend
I swear you crazy
Someone that's close to you reached out to me just to see if we had made amends (Oh)
[Chorus: Drake & Ty Dolla $ign]
Trust me, this ain't 'bout revenge
But now I get along better with your friend (Woo)
And it's wrong, I know (Know, know, know)
But again (Ooh, yeah)
Trust me, this ain't 'bout revenge
I get along better with your friend (Oh)
And it's wrong, I know, it's wrong, I know, oh

[Verse 2: Drake]
No
You said you felt, you said you felt
Something that's different from everyone else
You had the nerve to still ask for my help
Dug you out ditches, you buried yourself, ah-oh
You said you fell
And I took your word that night in our hotel
One thing about time, surely, time's gonna tell
Never had to work for much, so you said it yourself, ah-oh, oh
Can't let it go, can't get this out of me
This shit still bothers me
Don't you dare (Don't you dare)
Don't say you're proud of me
Hurt's just unreal to me

Why did you wait 'til the end?

139,You Only Live Twice,"[Intro]
M-M—, M-M—

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
No, I'm never gangbangin' in my blue Chucks
Money callin' so I threw the deuce up
Yeah, they plottin' on me but they gotta do somethin'
Told my dawg two-somethin' just to shoot somethin' (M-M—)
Left them niggas stretched out on the train tracks
Rather you than me, here come that payback
Got 'em lookin' for that paper that they can't tax
Yayo so clean, I told 'em call it, ""Ajax""
Hialeah celebrated when Fidel died
Patti LaBelle, who knew that we would sell pies?
Standin' on your own is when you realize
When all the lights go out, that's when you see the real guys
Back to the real niggas glowin' in the dark (M-M—)
Never perfect but you know a nigga heart
A rich nigga that'll pull up to the park
Get on one knee and tell the kids that they are stars
Bullet wounds don't be covered by ObamaCare
Your funeral was way too soon, that's if your mama there
Real niggas deserve to live twice (M-M—)
Plastic fork and some fried rice
[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, two-point-two for the Rafael Nadal
Don't act like you're happy for me now
Don't act like you wasn't prayin' for catastrophic collapses
Catalog is immaculate
Still runnin' the game, don't ask me about the practice
Ho, you go on vacation, don't ask me about relaxin'
Not sure if you know but I'm actually Michael Jackson
The man I see in the mirror is actually goin' platinum
Unthinkable when I think of the way these niggas been actin'
Yeah, I never did you nothin' and you play like we family, huh?
Next thing, you wanna shoot me down, it can't be love
Not sure where you was tryna send it, it can't be up
That day you sounded like a bitch, you fancy, huh?
Damn, how can I forgive like this?
I gotta dead a lot of shit just to live like this
I had to fuck a lot of girls to get a kid like this
I had to get a lot of cribs to get a crib like this, nigga
That's why I'm movin' all elusive
These boys on they last resort and it's givin' us all inclusive
Been spazzin' since CB was chunkin' up the deuces, nigga
Your shit was boo-boo, excuses, excuses, nigga

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Brrrt, may I speak to pussy niggas?
I just call it like I see it, I ain't even lookin', nigga
I just walk it like I speak and I ain't speakin' to them niggas
I ain't starvin', I'm just greedy, all I eat is pussy niggas
Don't wan' see these pussy niggas, y'all can't see me, pussy niggas
You keep talkin' like you eatin', I'ma feed you bullets, nigga
I might even cook a nigga, all my weed is cookies, nigga
Shove a 8-ball up her pussy like a fetus for me, nigga
I got bitches doin' lines, I'm Adidas to 'em, nigga
I got sentenced, took some time and it was easier than simple
I'm so difficult to fathom like a fever in the winter
I got women in the Phantom with they cleavage out the window
Long hair, lot of tats and I smell like the pack
Money trail right on track
Whip that big body Maybach like it's a little Pontiac
All my chains look like snakes, that's some real diamondbacks
Pull my hammer out her pussy, pull her nails out my back
I don't chill, I react
On the scale, my pockets fat, and to this whale, you like a ant
I'm a dog, if you a dog, then pull your tail up out your ass
And on this Codeine, I'm a turtle, it done shell-shocked my ass
I'm the hottest on the cellblock, I promise
I can fly to check my mailbox, invoices soundin' like Jill Scott
Pill popped, house in Hidden Hills on the hilltop
Her ears popped, she lick my lollipop and my teardrops, Tunechi","

141,Fucking Fans,"[Verse 1: Drake & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'm still working on me
And I'm coming back better for you (I'm comin' back, oh-ooh)
Most times it was my selfishness and your helplessness that I took advantage of
You sit in the house and I be out and I know you're worried, up (I know you're worried, you're worried, you're worried)
And you try and block it out
I'm so sorry for letting you down (Oh-oh, oh-ah)

[Refrain: Drake]
I should've came home, came home sooner
You'd probably still be there if I
Came home, love you like I treat ya
You'd still be there
My girl, my lil' baby speechless
You'd still be there, baby
[Verse 2: Drake & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'm still working on me (Work it)
And I'm coming back with a plan and there's money in my hand, baby (Work it)
You said I was fucking up when I was out here fucking fans, damn, and it made you look crazy
Made you seem, made you feel, it was crazy (Ooh-ah)
While you sit in the house, I be out and you stay worried about me (Oh)

[Verse 3: Drake]
Ayy, yeah
Nights when I just needed to hold somebody
Feeling overwhelmed, should've told somebody
Picturin' it's me sending chills through your body
I just probably should've chilled 'til I saw you
How am I supposed to get to know somebody?
Nigga left his 20s and I still wanna party
I can not be trusted on my own with nobody
I can not be
If we broke it off then you know it wasn't painless
If she got a watch then you know it's not a stainless
I was out here fucking fans, I was shameless
Yeah, and I know that
You was at the crib reading stories that they sent you
Most of that was bullshit but some of it I did do
Hard for me to justify the women I was into
Especially when the whole entire world wished they had you
Then I locked the door that night in Vegas 'cause I had to
Then I had a kid even though I never planned to
I cannot imagine when your girls gave you that news
I know that
Probably made you want to hit the streets on everything
Probably made you want to pour bleach on everything
Probably made you want to kill me on everything
Yeah, trust, I know that (Trust, I know)
Calendar must say two, zero, one, four
'Cause you're on the same shit that you was on before
I know you're not happy, girl, everybody know
Could see it in your boyfriend eyes at the show
Don't tell me let it go, I'm a letting go pro
You don't wanna grow but we gotta outgrow
Went six digits on the lock screen code
You crack  into that ho and it's gon' be a lot of smoke
We both getting rich but the trust getting broke
Tear me down with words but I know that's how you cope
Cover up a lot, can't cover up your soul
Know you're not happy, girl, everybody know

142,The Remorse,"[Intro]
Yeah (Huh)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Look, me and Lil Sandra bagging CDs in the bubble wrap
People recognize me from the TV, but I'm done with that
People don't wanna see me succeed, this shit come with that
Even when I come back, I don't know if it's me that's gonna be coming back
Soon as I left, I had to make peace with that
Dropped out of school 'cause nobody was teaching that
The Best Western is where a nigga was sleeping at
Daemen College booking me to pull up and speak the facts
Even if they make a movie 'bout us, this shit'll be hard to re-enact
Dislocated shoulder, it's hard to be always reaching back
All these IOU's, it's hard for me to be keeping track
Friends that dedicated they life to just keepin' me intact
Hard to pay 40, pay Noel, pay Niko back
All the nights I needed to vent to someone and CJ sat
All the nights Chubbs was pulling up where I need him at
All the times Mark was making sure that my luggage packed
Or times he had to double back (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I mean, even with his salary, you can't put no prices on that
There is no salary cap, there is no payin' him back, for real
I wonder what it could've been if I had snakes in the mix
Actually, I never wanna know 'cause we made it like this
Shots gotta fly either way, now I make it or miss
Overtime hours all good, we take it in shifts
What would you do if it wasn't this? That's a hard one
The finish line is where I like to pull up and start from
Pain is just a place that I go to get the bars from
Anxiety's a drug that I use to get the job done
Delusional's a space I like to think that I'm far from
My son is the one thing I hate to be apart from
Bet against me, don't know where they getting the odds from
I know that when it's done, I'm going wherever God's from
But I still don't know where I get the calm from
(Where I get the calm from) Yeah
[Interlude]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-ooh)
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, woah, woah, woah
Yeah (Woah, woah)
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Look, gotta hold my head high with two dry eyes
I told you everything is fine, dawg, but I lied
I be tryna draw the line, but it's a fine line
And I'm drownin' out the noise from the sideline
Sometime it's louder than the voice I got in my mind
I can't even hear myself when I get quiet time
Like, how they tellin' me I'm done, when I'm in my prime?
They've been tryna push a narrative since '09
And they even had my ass convinced a couple times
But that ain't even the half, I had tougher times
Only look for sympathy inside my mother's eyes
And it's whatever with them niggas on the other side
We got problems we could never really put aside
I cracked the door for us all, put my foot inside
I tried to kill them boys with kindness, but they wouldn't die
So now I kill 'em all for acting like they couldn't die (Yeah)
My hard work doesn't just pay off, it pays all the family debts off
I'm taking heads off, Future out here like Irving Azoff
Houses paid off, label paid off
My soul for the money wasn't the trade-off
Unlike most of you boys that fade off
I feel guilty taking some days off
Please don't google my net worth, the numbers are way off
I mean, if you comparin' it to what I really made off with
I'm more like Bernie with all the earnings that they came off
Trust me it was nothin' light, holmes
They tried to give me a slice of the pie, and I took the knife home
I know you love me
Can't picture bein' a hubby, finger too stubby to fit a ring on
Unless Kawhi wanna run it back
Other than that, the strings'll be unattached
Certified Lover Boy, I'm not the one for cuddling or none of that
Y'all music gets watered down, when you love 'em back
And you know what I'm on, blowing past ya, owning masters
Said you're like a father figure to me, but now daddy's not around so I'm a bastard
Oh, of course, the only villain that show remorse when I owe you more
Soft spot for all the ones that came before, I can't ignore it
I'm always tryna rekindle
From the bottom to the top, man, what's it like in the middle?
From the lemon faced radio host that love to be bitter
To my dogs in the game who wasn't pick of the litter
For the young Gs out here starting from the beginning
Nobody praying for you when you winning, don't forget it (Winning, don't forget it)

look me and lil sandra bagging cds in the bubble wrap
people recognize me from the tv but im done with that
people dont wanna see me succeed this shit come with that
even when i come back i dont know if its me thats gonna be coming back
soon as i left i had to make peace with that
dropped out of school cause nobody was teaching that
the best western is where a nigga was sleeping at
daemen college booking me to pull up and speak the facts
even if they make a movie bout us this shitll be hard to reenact
dislocated shoulder its hard to be always reaching back
all these ious its hard for me to be keeping track

Rest in peace to Lil Keed

[Verse 1: Drake]
Fuck a pigeonhole, I'm a night owl, this a different mode
I might have to make her paint a 6 on her pinky toe
Heard you with a shooting guard, just let a nigga know
I would have you courtside, not the middle row
All good, love, in a minute, though
I can't strеss about no bitch 'cause I'm a timid soul
Plus I'm cookin' up ambition on a kitchen stove
Pot start to bubblе, see the suds, that shit good to go
Hoes say I'm suave, but I can't get RICO'd
Bro think he John Wayne, I bought him yellow stones
Love the way they hang, babe, fuck the silicone
Everybody fake now, you could crack the code
Bustdown everything, set in rose gold
Dread talkin' to you niggas like I'm J. Cole
I can tell her head good before I even know
Bitch, don't tell me that you model if you ain't been in Vogue
Gotta throw a party for my day ones
They ain't in the studio, but they'll lay somethin'
Rest in peace to Drama King, we was straight stuntin'
You don't like the way I talk? Nigga, say somethin'
Gotta throw a party for my day ones
Pull up and you know it's us, the bass jumpin'
You don't like the way I talk? Then say somethin'
Get out my face, nigga

Took her panties off and this bitch thicker than the plot
All my exes ain't nothin', them hoes busted
If my opps ain't rappin', they ass duckin'
You ain't ready to pull the trigger, don't clutch it

The bad bitches waitin' on a nigga like I'm PND

I told her ass to kiss me in the club, fuck a TMZ
I used to want a GMC, when Woe was doing BNE
We revvin' up and goin' on a run like we DMC
I layup with her for a couple days, then its BRB
You rappers love askin' if I fucked, when you know we did
When you know we did
She came in heels but she left out on her cozy shit
Ayy, I'm livin every twenty-four like Kobe did
Shoutout to the 6ix, R.I.P to 8
Swear this shit is gettin' ate, I'm on ten for the cake
Get a lot of love from twelve, but I don't reciprocate
Fifty-one division stay patrollin' when it's late

Niggas see Drake and they underestimate
Take it from a vet', that's a rookie ass mistake, ayy

I had to cut some niggas off, they didn't mean me no good
I come from the ghetto, so my trunk is in my hood
She wouldn't wear no panties 'round me even if she could
Gave out plenty spankings 'til they got it understood
Fuck the nosebleeds, baby, come sit on this wood
If you know it's tension, don't come 'round me like it's good
I got street smarts and you can't get this out no book
I can't right my wrongs, but I can still write these hooks
Oh, time to get exposed
You ain't been from 'round here, nigga, come get off your show
Savage said you pussy and he hit it on the nose
But that board is opеn, why you actin' like it's closed?
I don't know
Y'all be goin' in and out rеcessions
The same way that I be goin' in and out of Texas
Or in and out my sessions, or in and out her best friends
Or in and out these courtrooms, my lawyer like, ""Objection""
Yeah, woah, woah
All my bitches Spanish, boricua
Water on my neck, these diamonds came with coral reefer
She from overseas, I had to buy her a new visa
Met your wife in Vegas, but I hit her in Ibiza
She a supermodel, so she only eatin' Caesar
Used to date a rapper, but he acted like a diva
Niggas hustlin' backwards, out here ballin' with the reup
Popped an Adderall, I feel like I can lift a tree up
Seen too many cameras, so I never lift my ski up (Yeah)

It's been thirty minutes, I don't feel nothin'
Oh shit, wait a minute, think I'm startin' to feel somethin'
Where you get this motherfuckin' pill from?
Heard they got some sanctions on my name
Heard they plottin' on my name, heard they bankin' on my name

Fashion Week, it's for the last decade, it's not for us
It's about the lights, the lights that we put on in the city
The lights of the Eiffel Tower
I'm in charge of it, I'm the one who's putting it on every day
And you try to flex next, next to me on the red light with your ugly, whatever, flexing, most expensive car, V12

You gotta motherfuckin' feel this shit, boy
(BanBwoi)
Woah

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
I got feelings for you
Hope you ain't lovin' the crew
How many bodies you got?
Pray it ain't more than a few
Know that you dealt with some lames
When you was young and in school
He had to pop your cherry
But I got it wet like a pool
She got a new G-Wag'
She wanna hit Highlight Room and show it off
Got a new body, girl, show it off
This a Brazilian, I know it's soft
Toned up and she got a six-pack
Look like she used to play volleyball
American Express, you can have it all
Code to the safe, you can have it all
Fuck your main page, what's your Finsta? I wanna know the real you
You started dancin' to pay your tuition, girl, I wanna know what you been through
You want a boutique or you wanna sell hair, just let me know what you into
If you out in public and he want your number, just tеll him, ""My nigga'll spin you""
[Chorus: Drake]
The way you make me feel thеse days
Somethin' gettin' dropped for you, baby girl
Smoke a nigga top for you, baby girl
Burn somebody block for you
The way you make me feel these days
Comin' out my body for you, baby girl
Wipe him like he snotty for you, baby girl
Comin' out my body for you

[Verse 2: Drake]
Damn, just turned on the news and seen that men who never got pussy in school
Are makin' laws about what women can do
I gotta protect ya, I'm a made man, tied in, all the way, baby
So I gotta respect ya
Niggas put hands on you in the past, insecure because your body is precious
Four words when I think about them is crusty, musty, dusty, rusty
Eight words when I think about us is fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me
Disrespect ya and I'll smack 'em
The texts that you send in captions
The videos we got ever leak, we goin' viral or goin' platinum
Don't worry 'bout your friend's story when I had her alone
She gon' try and put some extras on it, take you out of your zone
You know how it goes when they can't get a reservation up in Carbone
They gon' tell you it's a chill night, tell you how they'd rather stay home, yeah
Jealous-ass hoes, yeah
And I know what I said 'bout bein' in Vogue
But just like that R&B group from the '90s
Girl, one call, I'll get you in Vogue
One call, you in runway shows
One call, I'm sittin' front row
One wrong call from your ex nigga sayin' dumb shit'll get him sent home
One call and my niggas ten toes
Down to go wherever I say go

Leave your phone, come to mine
You'll catch a hint in due time
I think, think that I
Could fuck the idea of him outta your mind
He said he rap, he ain't signed, that ain't a good sign
Change your mind, good conversation and some rosé wine
Unless there's some other things you gotta mind
You mind me, ayy, ayy
The smoke got me talkin' in Dutch
A pill in Ibiza, so what?
She leanin' on me, I'm her crutch
She creamin' on me, I'm her crush
Her photos don't need a retouch
She askin' why haven't I nut
I didn't know we in a rush
Enjoyin' the moment, so hush
My album was payin' her bills
I don't еven need a deluxe
Hеr stomach is flat as fuck
She still fit that shit in her gut somehow
The fat musta went in her butt somehow
I don't even ask her what's up
She sayin' that shit is natural
Don't care if she makin' it up
I never put you in no Uber, girl
I'm always gon' send you a truck
I'm always gon' keep it a buck
You give me that shit and I'm stuck
[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
.30 on my waist
'Cause a lotta broke niggas 'round the way ridin' 'round town
And they lookin' for my face
Gotta pray to God above you, girl, you know that Savage love you
And I hope that you feel the same
Tryna be the one for you, but my nickname true
And I hope that I can change
Girl, you know that Savage love you, girl, you know that Savage love you

I gotta stop goin' Van Cleef, condo, third week
I like it, but I'm too geeked, tryna turn you up
I gotta stop goin' Lenci', Rollie, first week
You're misreadin' me, I'm too geeked, tryna turn you up
You were lost until me
I didn't get no finder's fee
You're actin' like a bride-to-be
Behind closed doors, slimin' me
Friends are all advisin' me
Sayin' I could die tryna turn you up
There's three sides to this story, girl
The one you subtweet
The one your group chat gets to read
The one you come and tell to me
I understand it finally
I'm tryin' to give you highs and you're plannin' our goodbyes
But I turn you up
It's my fault
Burnin' cash like it's lit on fire
Penthouse and some new attire
I fulfilled all of your desires
You don't work, but you act retired
'Cause you know that you're mine and it's my fault
It's my fault, it's my fault, for once I take accountability
It's my fault that you got superpowers on your knees
It's my fault for once, don't keep you grounded on your feet
It's my fault for once, I drain accounts to make you love me
It's my fault for once, it's one-sided loyalty
My fault for once, I'm payin' lawyer fees
Doin' things just to set you free, see you breathe
It's my fault for once, I got the Wagon, G
Got you ridin' 'round with niggas that are nothin' like me
It's my fault for once, that's how you make it seem

166,Pussy & Millions,"[Chorus: Drake & Lil Yachty]
I been out late night creepin', tryna slide on bitches
Posted up with the militia
Niggas ain't switchin', mind on missions
Mind on pussy and millions, mind on pussy and millions
I'm tryna call a sex symbol to eat my kids up
They say more money, more problems (Will)
Bring on the problems (Will)
Bring on the problems (Will)
Bring on the motherfuckin' problems
They say more money, more problems
Bring on the problems
Bring on the problems
Bring on the motherfuckin' problems, ayy
[Verse 1: Drake]
Braided up at Matsuhisa
Hit 'em then I get amnesia
Life ain't gettin' any easier
Flaca, Flacasita
I know that I'm not in love, she don't love me either
It's just hard to find the love, this shit keep on gettin' deeper
Who said it's cheaper to keep her?
I'd rather release her
Body and give it away like a feature
You know the procedure
Niggas is praying to God so we stay with the sweeper
I'm reppin' 4L and my twinny so treacherous introduce y'all to the leader
[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
Come to me with all the smoke
I like the money, for sure
But I love the hustle the most
She pretty, she show off her toes
And my Pateks, they came with a pole
Know this money bring envy and jealousy
I'm like, ""Fuck it, I want me some more""
Hit her from the back, she bent up
Playin' with the money, get spent up
Chains on my neck, no Kente
You the type of girl I pay rent for
Suck it in the car, that's what the tint for
Bought me a plane, not a sprinter
Quarter-million dollars on her dental
She say I'm a stepper, but gentle

Only signin' the gang
We the new Lucian Grainge
Bring on the rings (Yeah)
Her MJ thing, I'm talkin' a Brady thing
I'm off of the juice, never Canseco the mix
Rockin' the braids, not the twists
Full puff, he can't comb
Not actin' like Christians in here
But Christian Dior in they homes, the bigger we get
Gotta thank God for this, I got a lot that I give
I be handin' out gifts like the Christmas on twenty-fifth
Hidin' the twenties inside of the twenty-inch
Said I would buy the jet 'fore I could 'fford this shit
Now I got the jet, building the landing strip
In the back of the crib, I record the hits
In the front of the crib they valet the whips
(How many whips I need? Let's go)
Breakin', breakin' the records, more money, more problems
They come with the status
Runnin' through customs when you run the atlas
I got accustomed, accustomed the fastest
I'm talkin' 'bout fabrics, I'm talkin' 'bout mattress
I never sleep, though I sleep with a baddie
I'm movin' deep 'cause that's just how it's happenin' (Ooh)
If you come out, just be ready for action (La Flame)
Just needed some time
I settled my time, now they see the signs
You didn't leave me solo, right here, all alone
You held it down for me, right on my own (Ooh)
Young nigga get it, just try to get home
I got a rolodex all on my phone and it's still wrong

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, ayy
Hop in that bitch and I start the V
Snakes in the grass so they harder to see
My brother would give up his life to the O
He told me he gon' be a martyr for me
Said that she ready to come to the 6ix
I hit up Pauleen, the charter, the P
Ain't really lead but I'm back in (Back in), I'm back in (Back in), I'm back in (Back in)
I'm ridin' around in Atlanta with Sav
'Cause that nigga been goin' harder than me
Nothin' had changed, I'm just harder to please
Ferrari is makin' an SUV
We ain't got a choice, we orderin' these
Shout out Noel for recordin' the V's
[Chorus: Drake]
He know where this shit 'bout to go, 'cause nobody touchin' the flow
They say you alone at the top, but it's gotta be lonely below
You boys gettin' ready to diss, but don't even mention the O
And don't even mention a foe unless you boys tryna go broke

[Verse 2: 21 Savage & Drake]
Woah, I got more stripes than Adidas
(Yeah, I got the stripes, but fuck Adidas, nigga)
I don't chase bitches, I leave 'em
(Hoes screamin' like I'm Justin Bieber, nigga)
I don't get mad, I get even
(Hit you niggas like a buzzer beater, nigga)
I don't get mad, I get even
(Hit you niggas then you gone)
Woah, all that foundation she wearing, she think she QC
Tellin' all my sneaky links you with me
You must be Coach K 'cause you ain't P
I'm on a Jet like my last name Li
Two sticks in my hand like I'm playin' the Wii
G Block Babies will spank you for free
We rough niggas up, now they beggin' for peace (G Block Babies)
Steppin' on shit, I done fractured my toe
Born in October, I'm so OVO
Halloween come and he want to dress up but he don't need no costume, I'm turnin' him ghost
She called me mucus, I stay in her throat
Stick hit that boy, got his ass hittin' notes

[Verse: Drake]
Ah damn, man, you niggas is the worst
Savage snatch you out ya crib, then drop you in a hearse
Baby, please, when we nervous, stop reachin' in your purse
Nigga went and bought a house when he coulda bought a verse
Niggas dumb as fuck, imagine if I did that stupid shit when I was comin' up
My crib feel like a hedge fund, I be in here just thumbin' up
Know I'm SN1, 'til I'm done fuckin' London up
Niggas make me nauseous, I had enough of broke boys
I can't talk to broke boys, yeah, I can't talk to broke boys
I can't talk to broke boys, I can't talk to broke boys, wait, yeah
I can't talk to broke boys, I can't talk to broke boys, wait
All you niggas make me sick
All you niggas rappin' 'bout the bricks and the licks
Then I hear in real life you livin' with your bitch
I can't talk to broke boys, I can't talk to broke boys
I can't talk to broke boys
I don't want no convo I don't got no time for
Niggas postin' mansion, livin' in a condo
Y'all be make believin', I can't not relate to you
I can't talk to broke boys, I can't talk to broke boys
I cannot believe y'all was dissin' on the old boy
I can't even think on how you came up with that flow, boy
Please talk to someone else 'cause I can't talk to broke boy

168,Middle of the Ocean,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
I'm in the Missoni room at the Byblos
The boat was rockin' too much on some Aaliyah shit
For real
We goin' from the Vava to Cinquante-Cinq, then back to the Vava
If you know, you know, baby, I don't, I don't know what to tell you
Yeah
Ayy

[Verse: Drake]
Look
Long way from Sette Mezzo
Meet Tommaso and Ernesto
Short rigatoni with the pesto
These verses are my manifesto
Hallways got an echo
Me and Smiggz on the loose in the city, you know how the rest go
Casual sex, I'm like, ""Fuck a dress code""
The first martini is an espresso
Chill shot glasses with prosecco
Niggas so ignorant in our hood, they bе like, ""Why the fuck you makin' techno?""
I'm worldwidе and this is just another cargo jet flow, I had to let go
Life insurance policies, you niggas 'bout to need the gecko
I got some meaner threats, though
Me, Spider-Man, and Leonardo, I'm back tomorrow
I had the chopper to a wedding out in Monaco or Monte Carlo
I'm losin' track of where we all go
I wouldn't trade my life for none of y'alls, it's an embargo
Fifty-nine bags on the 767, this is heavy cargo
Yeah
Fifty-nine bags on the—, ayy
Swedish jail cell smellin' like some Carby Musk
For your birthday, your boyfriend got a party bus
Bottle signs, club lines, should've come with us
We left that shit in '09 when we was comin' up
I mean, these just my suggestions of course
EmRata here fresh off divorce
And I'm tryna look in her eyes, maybe express my remorse
If she want a rebound with me, I'm down to go get her some boards
I'm here for the moral support
Whippin' the Vespa off of six tequilas
Big Benjamins like the Pittsburgh Steelers
Drake, you got it
Robert Kraft sent the jet for us, that shit was patriotic
You would think we live in Baltimore, the way they ravin' 'bout the latest product
Teachin' niggas how to mind they business, and my latest stuff
Might be the only teacher that gets paid enough
That's why I'm in Hyde Park buyin' like half of Harrods
You niggas are too concerned with makin' sure y'all outfits gon' match in Paris
If we don't like you, you payin' tax and tariffs
Come to the 6 and I'm like the actin' sheriff, deputy
First got to America, niggas wouldn't check for me
No chance the kid'll make it here like vasectomy
They underestimated my trajectory
But now they gotta pay that shit direct to me
I send the label bills, bills, bills like the other two women standing next to Bey, that shit was just—
Independent women is lovin' the new appearance
Matter of time before I go net a Bey like a Paris
Like, ""Honey, you gotta know that I never wore Mike Amiris or never hopped in a Urus""
I got my head in the clouds, I'm serious
The lyrics begin to reveal themselves over time periods
Promise you'll get that shit when the sky clears
This shit designed for divine ears
My favorite two words from you white boys is, ""Sign here""
And then comes the sound of glass clinkin' from a wine cheers
Swear I'm pocket checkin' y'all for five years
And then we 'bout to kick this shit in high gear
Eight karats like vegetarians, nigga, the earrings are droopy
Contract Lord of the Rings, think it's a script for the movie
Shout out TVGUCCI, my cousin is spooky
I swear you don't even mean what y'all say like y'all dubbin' a movie
Sidebar, Serena, your husband a groupie
He claim we don't got a problem but
No, boo, it is like you comin' for sushi
We might pop up on 'em at will like Suzuki
Kawasaki, sushi, saké, the money grow on trees like shiitake
They tried to get spicy with me, so I wonder how they gon' stop me
I'm really on a roll like hamachi
The fuck would y'all really do without me?
For your birthday, your man got a table at Hibachi
Last time I ate there, Wayne was doin' numbers off the cup like Yahtzee
And Paris Hilton was steady duckin' the paparazzi
Quavo might've sent me a song that he called ""Versace""
I really can't remember it properly
All I know is that God got me, I'm sittin' on large properties
Treat me like a newborn, Lucian not droppin' me
I'm goin' Pink Floyd, you niggas cannot rock with me
She could be givin' me head and somehow you not toppin' me
Niggas see the 6ix God pass, they high-fivin' me
Need to be high-sixin' me
Swear niggas highkey sick of me
They wifey on my head 'cause I vibe differently
Feel like an AMBER Alert the way that I can take her to the mall and she find Tiffany
I'm like a cup holder the way that these dimes stick to me
They should've been in the fountain based on what y'all wishin' me
[Outro: Birdman]
Know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah
Million-dollar spot (Brr, brr)
That's how motherfuckers in CMB play it
Middle of the ocean (Blatt)
Just like that (Shine, shine)
All dark fresh green water
Land that thing
With 'bout a hundred hoes
We up and we livin' like that, boy
Fresh fly fish like, you understand me, like, real G shit
You hear me? A neighborhood superstar
It's bigger than anything
You know, we start from the bottom, then we come to the top
Get to the top and we stay up there
You hear me? (Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball)
We look down and we'll be down, but we stayin' up
And we rise up, we stay on 'em, you heard me? (Ball, ball, ball, ball, ball)
Big Florida water, big water ocean
On that type of time
You understand me?
Rich nigga, rich life, you understand me?
Come from the bottom, but we come from the bottom (Rich life)
But we understand the bottom 'cause we come from it
And we live with it (You understand?)

I ain't wastin' time that I'm never gettin' back
Takin' less L's, makin' more M's

Take it to the paint, take it to the rim

Plenty switches with extensions, it's no fun
Givin' out spankings
Ridin' with lil'— 'cause he shoot without thinkin'
Baptize a nigga, send him home in a blanket
Upgrade a bitch and put some diamonds in her anklet
Better not get no throw up on my seat, I know you drinkin'
You ain't fuck no rapper, you a dinosaur, you ancient
I like fried rice, you better cook like you an Asian
Wrote a lot of verses, but I never wrote no statement
I been in them rooms, I never did no contemplatin'
This bitch wanna argue, I ain't doin' no debatin'
Seen her with her nigga, waved my hand, I'm like, ""Hey, friend,""
Lookin' at the Shade Room, that shit be entertainin'
Tryna turn an opp into a motherfuckin' painting

Knife to a gun fight, this ain't none of that
Had to cut her off, she got too attached
I ain't wastin' time that I'm never gettin' back
Takin' less L's, makin' more M's
Put her Skims on, now she actin' like she Kim
Take it to the paint, take it to the rim
You look good on camera, baby, let's go make a film

6 God lurkin'
Come up off that bag for the boy that keep working
Dissin' on his album and it flopped, he deserved it
Come up out that booth and bring that energy in person
Got so many hits, it wouldn't be fair to do no verses
I could really go five hours in the stadium
What happened to that nigga claiming OVO? We traded him
Thought I was a popstar, I'm Slaughter Gang, I baited 'em
Walk around like Prince 'cause I got a lot of lady friends
Used to be in 'Sauga out at Sega City Playdium
Skatin' through this album like a Montreal Canadien
Way that I ran shit, you'd think I was Iranian
Niggas see my deal, look at they deal and now they hate the kid
Fuck, let me kick it basic
Niggas ain't got love for the boy, so they fake it
Crack a couple jokes to some bitches on some snake shit
But if I send a verse to they ass, then they'll take it
Shoot a video, arm around me like we aces
Or pop out at my shows, jump around with me on stages
Probably why these hoes love to shower me with praises
Might've fucked a rapper, girl, but you ain't fucked Drake yet
Yeah

171,3AM on Glenwood,"[Verse]
Woah, I get rid of all the smoke like Ozium
Shorty got that real jelly, yeah, petroleum
Niggas actin' like my kids and they be older than him
Can't believe they killed Skiney, I really growed up with him
I'ma leave a lot of niggas covered in roses for him
Spray the witness, I ain't leavin' no Jehovah for them
Won a GRAMMY and I couldn't even show it to him
Put my face inside a line up, niggas know that I'm him
Anybody speakin' on my brothers got stepped on
Pull up from the three like Stеphen
And the coupe bald-hеaded like the other Stephon
Put my kids in private school so they could get they prep on
Think my heart made out of Teflon
What? What? Think my heart bulletproof
You ain't got a mask, I can show you what a hoodie do
Pull the string tight 'til your eyelids covered too
I think they on the left, roll the window, hit the lights, boom
Everybody wish they switched sides when we comin' through
Everybody wish they was inside when we comin' through
I pray that you ain't on the other side when we comin' through
PTSD and I mean it
Nigga, Johnny got killed and I seen it
I can't fight with these demons
Top shotta, nigga, I got gunfire for these demons
Hope you know you gotta stand on all that shit you been tweetin'
Took some real niggas from me, I could kill the whole world and I still won't be even
I be thinkin' 'bout my brothers while I'm shoppin' in Neiman's
Real gangster, when I'm gone, carve my name in the cement
Watch these hoes when you rich, they play games with the semen
Trials and tribulations, I face them
Prosecutors probably wanna case him
See my opps, I jump out and chase them
I ain't Charleston White, nigga, I'll never Mace them
Love for all my artists, nigga, I'll never Mase them
Shit, that's probably why they hate him
Tryna get my brother out of jail, I'm like, ""Hey, Kim""
Cut from a different cloth, he never let it break him
Look at my advance, it make me wonder, would I make them?
But I own my masters, so I can't do shit but thank them
Video visits, he be smilin' on FaceTime
Passionate, I'm talkin' with my hands, these ain't gang signs
You don't know Larry, Tayman, or CJ, you ain't one of mine
Braids on my neck, nigga, I ain't got no hang time
Nigga, I ain't got no kick-it for you
I don't wanna make friends
I don't wanna make amends
I'm chasin' Ms

You said fuck me, and I was like, ""Cool""
So now what's the problem?

[Chorus]
Don't go hiding again
Tired of asking where you been
You left so abruptly
I guess it's fuck me
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Tell me, what did I do wrong?
Before it's over
I need you to come over once again
And before you give me closure
Need you to come a little bit closer
[Verse]
Still steppin' like Omega Psi Phi for mine
If bein' real was a crime, I'd be doin' life
Like that nigga not nicе, I don't know polite
I'm the first evеr antisocial socialite
The pain that I seen in my mother's eyes in 2009
Have me workin' 'til it's 2049
And get hate when I tell you, ""Oh, some other time""
Like I really got some other time
You just tell me, ""Never mind""
Know I sound crazy to a lazy mind
Know it'll be a different kind
Shout out to the people workin' nine to five
I be workin' nine to nine
And the six upside down, it's a nine
You already know the vibe
And they leave 'cause of pride, but they comin' back every time
The devils that I recognize, most of them got pretty eyes
Titties and some plans of just gettin' by, that's the way they live or die
Easy to judge, but, girl, who am I?
Truth or dare, I'ma take a double dare
Truth is a suicide
I would rather live a lie, keep you on the outside
Introduce you to the guys
Have you throwin' up the south side like you're one of mine
But you're not one of mine
You belong to everybody else when you're bored in your free time
Shit could make a thug cry, play it like a tough guy
Couldn't even land in the Hamptons, they didn't have the stairs for the shit I fly
Swear it's like a metaphor, I can't even get down from the shit I climb
Can't even get down from the shit I climb
Yeah, girl, you're my size
Make me tell you one time
We was on the front line, shit was in my bloodline
Waitin' for the sunshine
But the sun never shines on me, on me
Sleepin' in the whip sometimes, girl, I was sleepin' upright
Henny, red cup life, broski kept it tucked tight
Niggas talkin' bare shit about what they gon' do to mine
Aw, now their tongues tied
We was smokin', watched the sun climb
I would trap until my thumbs cried
Tryna change it all in one line
Never seen a thug cry
Love, it's been a long time
Bet you never seen a thug cry
Hit me on my hotline
And no, ma, I'm not fine at all

174,Pianist Hands,"Thank you Ms. Graham for coming today. You look very nice today, sorry, that's not professional, I guess. They say in Canada, don't mingle business with pleasure, or something like that So, we have to talk about Aubrey, or how he likes to be called, Drake. As I always like to say, there is room for improvement in his learning from piano. He talks a lot, huh? He socialize when I'm teaching. Okay, and when it's time for him to play, he doesn't have pianist hands. If you need example: me, Mozart, and Ray Charles all of us have pianist hands. I'm the only one living with this hands, I guess. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding. Umm it seems like he likes the music and he obviously has a reason, but there is so much room for improvement, you know? Speaking of improvement, I don't think you, Ms. Graham need any of it. Heh I'm kidding, I'm just kidding, haha",
175,Special,"[Intro]
Uh yeah man, VO
Back again like we never left huh
I'm sending this out to any of my girls thats different man
Anybody thats special
You know I wanna be honest with you women so I'mma start off like this

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh look, I'm bold from the get go, go by the title of Drake
And treating me like the rest is a vital mistake
I'm hopin that ain't nobody else as special as you
When I say I've been disappointed I'm addressing a few
I finesse then I groove
While most of the 8 to 9's in my past
Now get a rating thats less than a 2
Its true, I been talking to Aleshia, Keisha and Nadia
And Shadia, had to throw peace signs to a lot of ya's
Payback, to the same chicks from way back
Never call, now they wanna be where I stays at
Now they got the new boy, I'm trying to move forward
And pass me, classy, something like Drew Lord
A new me, cool, see I never get around
If I dont change now I dont think I'll ever settle down
Even if I gotta travel a bit
I'll go around the world and back
Cause I know that once I have it thats it and uh
[Hook]
(Yeah man; yeah)
You can't just love me like they do
(Talk to 'em V; I need somebody special in you girl)

(Put ya hands up ladies; Yeah man)
See I've been searching I don't what to do
Can you help me?
(Uh)
She gotta be special
(Yea; You gotta hold me down baby)
By that I mean that you gon hold me down
(Uh)
You gotta be special
(Yeah; You never know right?)
Cause you never know how people stick around
(Uh)
Gotta be special
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me
Yeah my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be

[Verse 2: Drake]
Since a young dude the flow was nasty acidic
Ever since the demo dog
And groupies are gettin' brave
Now they ask me for
Rappers, I write 'em a verse
And ask me to spit it
But I pay no mind though
Cause they know I know
Hard as these niggas working man
They won't sign so
Drake and VO back
I take it you know that
You take it sitting down
Or you can take it to gold black
And since Drake done took it from curls to waves
Its been kind of like a whirlwind phase
I mean I had my share of women
Now a nigga gettin' girls for days
With most of 'em its seemin' like they world is staged
But from Georgia to BK and all around the world
Get your hands in the air if your avoiding the cliche
If you've been hurt and you alone be steady
These the same dudes from rewind, grown and ready, and uh

176,Do What You Do,"[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Verse 1]
Getting down tonight if they say you cuttin'
A lot of dudes in my city, they ain't saying nothin'
A lot of records from here, they get no play
And these labels don't give advances so you get no pay
Them little rims on the ride, Imma let those stay
So these nosy niggas don't know that I get checks all day
'Whats he worth?' Fans keep trying to guess it
My record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it
Boi-1da and Drake if it's beef I address it
And the black Phantom is here soon as Visalia exit
Both of the deals, nothin' under a mill
We know you got it to give and we trying to collect it
Long as I got me some heat through the winter
Drake known as a pro, I'ma teach you beginners
'Bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer
For features, y'all better get me while it's cheaper than dinner
'Cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl
If you see her tell this nigga got some beats Imma send her
[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all

You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Verse 2]
Check, the verses I'm writin', you might wanna learn it
You hatin' my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake, might wanna return it
'Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl
She'll forget you and I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just notice me now
But I was here along, your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed, wilin' in this, you ask me what the business is
And I'll write a sixteen and record it
The waiting is over I think music needed
Drake cuttin' his records without gettin' weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed
I got this dude they expectations I'ma exceed it
Like a single with only backgrounds
Y'all record and when it's done, ya lyrics tend to mislead shit
Finally here I'ma star with the timin'
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclinin'
This for anybody that's searchin' for cash
And purchasin' fast, you only get the dough when you grindin'
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne

177,Money (Remix),"[Produced by Frank Dukes]

[Intro: Drake]
Southern Smoke
It's Southern Smoke baby!
(Money) Frank Dukes
(Money) My man Nickelus F
(Money) Ho! It's Drake. Southern Smoke
(Money) This is the remix right here
(Money) So if you got some (Money)
Put ya hands in the air
(Money) Southern Smoke
[Verse 1: Drake]
Now-a-days you sayin' that I should go Jermaine, I should go Pharrell
Either or my nigga, make sure you don't get shelled
(Right) Make sure your money's right and they do a promotion well
So you could get checks cut like Benedict in Ocean's Twelve
This ain't Brad Pitt, I gotta admit
I'm sick of seeing chicks in that Louis V and that Plaid shit, cause it's a bad fit
They say my father lives through me, so this is just basically how my dad spit
I know my cash come quick when it's sunny
You know a girl is special if I stick with her honey
If it wasn't for dummies chick would still have money
And if it wasn't for money Nick would still have Skummy
So, guess it's kinda like a gift and a curse
To jip money is easier than liftin' a purse
If you pick the wrong mother who'll snatch you, run for cover
A week later you might find ya click in a hearse, boy!

[Chorus: Drake]
I, take time arrange that (Money)
Some, kill just to claim that (Money)
Switch countries exchange that (Money)
You cannot get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right (Money)
There's, no need to stash right (Money)
Got the same, four G's from last night (Money)
You cannot take that from me, homie

178,AM 2 PM,"[Verse 1: Nickelus F]
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club, I was up I'm tryna live
Only twenty two, my nig, 'bout to be twenty three, ya dig?
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life
I realize how many leave they wives so deep inside
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church
My congregation bombed the nation with this hip hop
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the pit stops
I heard the prize was some chicks and a wrist watch
And all you gotta do is go to jail or get shot
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put an end to all the bickerin'
And tell them niggas this is Nick's spot
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked
Saran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh?
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh?
Reached to do it and realized his dick stuck
[Chorus: Drake]
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
I'm trynna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em ho's
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

[Verse 2: Drake]
Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane and party where the best have been
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win
Virgina gon' rep for him, and Memphis represent for me
To the tenth degree, Tennekey, T-Dot to the country y'all
Orange Mound and Whitehaven, and back up north to Montreal
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map
People get to thinking they really light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap
So they give it pass the torch and sell they soul for enough to throw cash in storage
Maybe they can bring they career back
But these niggas right here ain't trynna hear that
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check
My cousins, they paint they slabs and pop pistols to get respect
This can't be life, dominoes and chief and dro and twenty stacks
Single mothers phonin' cheaters just to get they honeys back
Purple drink and trips to Kroger's just to get they money stacked
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny
Pull the jackrabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at?!

179,City Is Mine,"[Verse 1]
This the record that my backpack underground fans get to skippin'
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin'
Chasin' fat stacks, runnin' down grands and submission
I don't back track, every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice, I just got clean rap
I don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin' beside's all bossed up
Burglar minded they say I'm servin' them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater, uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow
Peep though, when I get fed up, it’s sped up
Riding through the streets, just reclining in my seat hoe
Uh, them city lights is looking brighter, its 3 a.m. in the morning An' the pen is like a lighter
I’m just a writer flaming pages of a notebook, my Rachel McAdams get At ‘em when I ignite her
Yup, soon as a couple plan a trip, you smell gasoline I’m burning All up and down the strip, strip
I done said it, I give you the unleaded, just tip me, if your tank Is empty come get me
[Hook]
Yo, the city is mine  (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

[Verse 2]
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose
There's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but
You got a debt and you choose not to pay that
I'mma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh
I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier
So hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of

181,Bad Meaning Good,"[Verse 1: Slakah]
Lady, you say I stay in the house til four
We don't even go out no more
Its always the same eh
Always complainin, it's obvious baby
I guess you don't watch the news
You see theres a lot to lose
Cuz we got a baby and people are shady

[Bridge: Drake]
My generation is changin
Aside from the fact
The dealers have customers they provide with the crack
Front of the buses taken
And we deny it from the back
You can die where you from, or die where you at
[Chorus: Drake]
Don't put it past them
I don't think that they understood
My friends they ain't even sit in the class when they should
He can come pick you up
If your dads in the hood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

[Verse 2: Slakah]
Lady, somebody shot up the place right by
Where I work and I think they might
Be coming for me next, klend me ya Kleenex
I'm tellin you baby

Still gotta go out tonight
Cuz I gotta feed you, I hope that I see you again
A-a-again

182,Thrill Is Gone,"[Chorus: Voyce]
Love's lost, love's gone
Love lost, love is gone
Love's lost, love's gone
Love lost, love is gone

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look
In this world of desperate housewives and freakin players
Rappers they tend to be smilin'
Because they swimmin' in women
Most of em seeking favors
They come in secret flavors
That's why I envy Omar
Because so far I'm nowhere close to Malik and Deja
And that's some higher learning
Trying to excel with the brake on
I'll have you stuck in the same spot with the tires burnin'
And I'm a liar turnin' 19, jaded with no faith
In any female that's askin what I was earnin
I met this recent lady
She knew a piece of Sadie by Spinners
I guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe
Well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby
Cause she ain't give me the butterflies that Aleshia gave me
It's like I'm using some bread to sop up some decent gravy
Now I'm out of both and I've been thinkin' of Alisha lately
[Refrain: Drake]
I'm all alone, I got a feelin it's on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of chillin' is gone and uh

[Chorus: Voyce]
Love's lost, love's gone
Love lost, love is gone

[Verse 2: Drake]
Some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces, circling workplaces
And following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is
They get to first bases
Then they get to retreating cause if she cheatin'
He wanna know what the first trace is
Now you like MacGyver, cause you sneakin' around
And she don't know that you there when you standin' right beside her
I can relate to that
I had to take it back a couple of years
When some of the best kicked it with Drake in fact
I bet that they knew it cause in my mind I play through it with
And in the end I listen but I don't see me as they do
Cause it's my opinion, my life, my potentials for my wife
And I used to be eager to buy em the world
Maybe I'm confused about what I desire from girls

[Refrain: Drake]
Either way I'm all alone, got a feelin' it's on
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin' is gone and uh

Of being in the background with your asses shakin'
Hittin' clubs and skippin' out on the class you takin'

To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin' cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Ya'll part of the speech 'cause

I'm from the city where
People be gettin' lazy, litterin' in the streets
And the club district is poppin' like literally every week
And promoters'll push flyers, money exchange hands
Liars sell you they dreams and dummies exchange plans
Hustlers give you events, bouncers give you pass
Directors give em a shot, so girls'll give up the ass
And groupies that would flock to hometown athletes
And start rolling together like Snoopy and Woodstock
Daffy and Bugs, its all laughing and hugs
Til the dude catch a plane and she back where she was
Right back on the bus, it's a shame cause now
At his window she throwin' bricks like Shaq in the clutch
You can see that's shes colder 'cause he doesn't hold her
Fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder
Know that he tried ta told her that he couldn't mold her
If this the type of chick you wanna be when you older, I say

N'a mean?, I'm a tell ya a Story real quick

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, she got a saying theres no alice without the tin man
Crib was 2 mil, plus I just bought a couch for ten grand
Even if the house was ten grand
And there was no pool
Would I still be without my swim fan?
The ceiling could be higher
She making requests
Don't know if she feeling me or she be feelin what I buy her
And purses are light now
She use 'em all the time
So she smilin to the the point that it hurt when she bite down
And she simply a new model
Stay spendin dollars
But she got less sense than a empty perfume bottle
At times she a solid chick
And I'm a sucka for the cuties
So she always lookin good when my wallet's thick
Chillin on the linen, she all up in the closet so much
Got a hunch thats shes feelin other women
Want the diamonds on the face in the center
Nice guys finish last so I'm winnin every race that I enter and she a
[Chorus: Sean G. & Drake]
Video girl
Eh, yo you have to listen
I'm in a bad position
I fell in love with a
Video girl
I wouldn't call her name
I got the feelin that they all the same
And she a
Video girl
To the fullest extent
So I wrote you a song
Cuz I can't stay with a
Video girl
And you betrayed your wealth
Got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself

[Verse 2: Drake]
My old girl would say
Look at Vida Guerrera
There's no need to compare her
I bet she smiles cuz she loves what she sees in the mirror
I bet she's out meetin' directors instead
And frustrated cause shes already been undressed in they head
Be a teacher, open up shop if you can do nails fine
Apply for a business loan and I'll bet you that they'll sign
If you a real dime
Poppin as if its your only option
Girl there's things to do
Other than jail time
Look this ain't a song dissing half of these rappers
Or pasha and sasha, esther baxter
Melyssa ford, or katy or anyone after
I just give my opinion for laughter
Or maybe to think on
So next time you out at the club
And a brother offers the whole table something to drink on
You just take in fact he got a stack with a mink on
Now he got you doing everything that you think wrong
Look, you tell your parents that its cash at an easy pace
Ya dad screaming take ya ass outta jeezy face
And as ya man I won't back down first
But they got you doing soft-core background work
That messed up like an officer that pulls you over
And he ask questions later and pat down first
But you ain't thandie newton, and this ain't crash here
The resolutions passed baby, this ain't last year
Look, I got a message, I'll say it, I got some beats still
Regina Hall and Garcelle and Elise Neal
Young girls these here women with big dreams
Role models that you can watch on the big screen
If you refuse to change and you that chick still
Respect yourself, don't be convinced that these tricks will
You got an audience believe it or not

A lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the Winter
But listen

[Verse 1]
I met this new girl late June or early July
I called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
Now it's December, I'm driving, and she's like ""Where's my hi?""
It's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy
See that was a segue, I believe the matter
Is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter
Where the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up
Drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up
Where girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in
The winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
And some places is breezy, and some it start snowin'
And if you planning family vacations you better know when
But some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
Instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity
Cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos
Where Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!
[Interlude]
Yeah man
It's a funny thing going through the winter up here man
A lot of girls y'know, wanna get close
You might think they the one
But just wait, nah mean, take it slow

[Verse 2]
Forget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach
She lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet
Since I'm driving, I ask her how to get to the suite
She doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat
She throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat
She's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet
Then she says ""I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat
I mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat
I love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good
There's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat""
Off this I'm kinda taken back for a second
I get her number she tells me to call her after this session
And so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch
Until we end up sexin' and now my heart attached
I'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern
And realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho!

[Interlude]
Yeah, uh
I told ya'll I had a story for you right
Uh, ya man, it's what it is

187,Extra Special,"[Intro]
Yeah, Ho!
It's Drake, uh, uh, Ho!
Do that dance, do that dance

[Chorus]
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
[Verse 1]
Look I ought to be thankful with women I have plenty of luck
And when it comes to relationships, many is stuck
Look at fifty you make love, thirty you have sex
Somewhere around the tender age of twenty you fuck
Or maybe before, I'm here waiting to score
It's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
Instead these girls taking it raw
Now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
Forget, wait till it's right, now it's wait till it's more
Wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
So they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
To the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie
But once they have my pants and my khakis
I tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
Because, I hate waking up undressed with a dame
And guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined to change

[Chorus]
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

188,About the Game,"[Intro: Drake]
Ho, yeah, uh huh
It's Trey Songz and uh, D-R-A-K-K-E
Ahahaha, the boys of summer are here man
Ayo Trey, I got something mean for this one boy

[Verse 1: Drake]
Chances are most of the days you was lying around
I made money thats why these girls eyeing me down
By nineteen I might seem destined for millions
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled in
I take cues from my big boy Popz
I'm the only young dude that the big boys watch
They getting foul on the star
But it's all eyes on me like I'm copying some vows for the bar
Get it?
Guess not
Picture me not strive
To land in the top ten slip in the top five
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me?
Nowadays I peak they interests
Especially when life's bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
Money making brothers should take notes
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
Somebody get the waiter
They need a second plate a this knowledge
If you ain't got it you could catch it later
My money and love is separate before I commit to date her
I put a split in the middle and learn to separate her
[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
Girl that's how it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't 'bout the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It ain't about the rims on my truck (No)
Ain't about the ice on my watch (No)
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game (It's about the game)
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch (No)
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game (Bout the game, uh)

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
When you ask why I hustle in the streets that's just who I be
Yo, I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
But without it all I'm still about the game

Girl, I've been thinking about the way, that you love me every day

Uh, uh, uh (Ho!)
Yeah, yeah (Let me get a little gospel on them, yeah, Uh)

[Verse 2: Drake]
They say he wanted the bounce back
I can easily make them admit that the bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah, you best believe
That I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So, they don't like me
They throw parties, and yet they never invite me
I can't lie, sometime it bother me slightly
Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm, and it's obvious of who can't tell
And no, this ain't Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection, though we both got the light complexion
Couple things I do damn well
And the way that I Jack son, you figure Drake knew Sam L
I'm for real though
I'm from Memphis, I'm often labeled as Trill so
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble, but I live fame
For more deals on the table than abridge game, ah

190,Drake’s Voice Mail Box #3,"[Message 1]
Hey, yo, Drake, you never answer your goddamn phone, huh? Pick up the phone, man. I know they got you running around, bro. Anyway, it’s all good with Socrates hooking you up, dawg. Hey, best wishes for this tape. I hope you take over the world. You know we gon' do it. You make sure you get me on there. You call me when you need that hook, you call me when you need that beat, you call me when you need that [hot 16], bro, and let’s put this whole mathematics together, dawg. Once again, it’s a whole gang from Room for Improvement, so we about to be taking over this year, right? Riiight

[Message 2]
Yo, Drake. What up? This is Keeyaga, your boy here. Umm, I don’t know why you’re not picking up the phone, you’re probably out, you know, talking to Lindsay Lohan, or will be talking to Tyra Banks whatever. But, yo, check it out, it’s your boy Keeyaga. I’m just calling to say what up, haven’t talked to you in forever, indefinitely. You know, we need to go, you know, downtown Toronto, kick it together and do what we gotta do, but, uh, I gotta, you know, get off the phone because I have, you know, Beyoncé, you know, Eva Mendes all on the other line. So, yo, do what you gotta do, and holla at your boy man. All the best. Peace",
191,A Scorpio’s Mind,"[Intro: Nickelus F]
Niggas in the city hating me man they tripping
When I'm the only one that's really spitting
My nigga Lil Lee the only one that's really gripping
Why you dap me up acting like like we cool if you don't feel him nigga?
Uh, I'm bringing back hip hop
Me and my nigga Drake
VA, Toronto, Hip-Hop

[Verse 1: Nickelus F]
Aiight let me take my jacket off
Unlace the Timbs, here again comes the jabberjaw
This time I'm blabbing on
These rappers that feel a certain way but they give me dap and all
Mad cuz the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
I got the gift like Santa Claus
Flow got spring like a catapult
Matter fact the flow Supreme like Diana Ross
I'm at the do' like a deer with the antlers off
Niggas acting like Scummy was they nigga
Wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar feature
I know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya
I said nah lets keep it peaceful
My nigga was a true weed source
He gave it to us for a cheap cost, at prices we all could eat off
A real street dog
The type of nigga that y'all niggas be studying learning how to get street off
We have an impostor, alert the doctor
Bout to hit him up with the chopper like Blaka
Shock em like Blanka from Street Fighter, heat got a
Hurricane kick, murder everything quick
Look, my new Ryu nine is stupendous
Why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
My crew lie you guys into ditches
I said it and meant it the Scorpio's Mind has many dimensions
I'll say it in intent, sentence, indent, on instant pimpin
Hope your listenin' to my diction
If you are then you now should be itchin'
That it's crack we placed in your stereo system
Yeah, I be at your burial trippin'
Nickelus F from Richmond, VA
The Scorpio's Mind is not a game to play wit all day
[Verse 2: Drake]
I've been hated by many, wanted by plenty
Disliked by some, but confronted by none
Since they don't show me sincerity, I load up, lock up
Take shots at em I guess you could call it a parody
And compared to D
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me
If that's not how it is it's how it appear to be
You got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader
And when the psychic get to touching my palm
Seein' your physical, the things that you never say to me visible
Especially when one of your artists feeling threatened
Cause I'm harnessing a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection
Mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
And play around, to perfection I'm the spitting image
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you I'm spitting image
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish
My verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin Hova
And writing college rhymes, look the thrill is over
Let me assist you like a specialist
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
It's not a problem wit X, I guess I'm a pessimist
Which means if shit goes bad I say, ""I expected this""
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate
Instead of understanding its a tune of hate
The city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state
And we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
So, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
You ain't Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut
And lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar
You still a protegé, that's the reason I don't holler
You got rappers being repetitive actors
You stay ahead of the game, I'm ahead of the practice boy","

192,S.T.R.E.S.S.,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, Ren, M.O.F, Haha
It's Drake man, it's Drake man.Yeah
Ayo Ren this that gritty shit here man
I'ma have to tell them about I been through on this know what I mean
HO! Southern Smoke!!!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Very few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it with lyrics
Or can't do it in spirit, they cancel what they doin'
The samples that they usin', can't get through the clearin'
I'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it
My father's early careerin' forced my parents to split up
My mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up
With just being a florist, so the choir sang his chorus
And he got back into doin' what he was doing before us
Because money is an issue, your son, he gon' miss you
And plus you got a wife at home cause mommy still exist too
Now you lookin' for exes, you ain't never expect this
You end up doing time, and me, I end up with a step-sis
Nobody passing judgment, they question where the drugs went
You know I hold you down because without you, I'd be a wasn't
And mommy I'mma support her, I keep it all in order
See her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border
But
[Hook: Nickelus F]
I got stress on my shoulders
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is makin' it colder
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
I'm just tryna live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!

[Verse 2: Drake]
This is my life, and so the rest has kinda been cool
Question what I been through
I write a verse addressin' it
And yes I might offend you
Picture when I was in school
Me being the closest thing to black
And guess what rap music what I was into
Rest of the kids were sheltered
I never liked to fight
But when someone called me a ""nigga""
I'd punch em I couldn't help it
Now I'm grown I can say what it is
It's parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raisin' they kids
And your daddy want it very right
I make you happy, plus I'm Jewish, he don't approve
I think he want you to marry white
He want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White
Cause black is black honey, even if he's very light
And so I never been for dinner at they places
Always brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces
I live it so the case is, whether Drake is
Way ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist

193,Try Harder,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough
To feel what I'm about to say in this song
When they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself
And you do it and get the feeling it's wrong
That there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
And they try to make you out as a lie
It's ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason
It's a lose lose why even try
When your ideas so frequently get rejected
People just get neglected
And they never really know how to feel
Phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics
And the motives to try and make them a mill
You never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and
They just wanna say that you ain't around
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming
That you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town
[Chorus]
You gonna try to try harder cuz
Try harder cuz
Try Try-Try-Try

[Verse 2]
And the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin' is fresher
Than most of these rappers running the game
Certain people will copy what's in the past to turn the profit with cash
There's time I would have done it the same
I mean I got me a Range
Also got me a guilty conscience
That made you tell anybody I meet that I rent
Sometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers
And watched the game from the bleachers
Because I'm really tend to need what I spent
In a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time
I wasted out late at the club
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I'm working hard on the winter
So this album is a labor of love
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats
That she can rest without a toss and a turn
Because she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on TV
That's exactly why I often get burned
But I'm gonna try to..
","
sometimes i feel like lohan and hilary duff are the only ones with enough
to feel what im about to say in this song
when they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself
and you do it and get the feeling its wrong
that there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping
and they try to make you out as a lie
its ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason
its a lose lose why even try
when your ideas so frequently get rejected
people just get neglected
and they never really know how to feel
phone calls is something that youre expecting for someone without the ethics
and the motives to try and make them a mill
you never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and
they just wanna say that you aint around
i mean theres always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming
that you couldnt help and maybe next time you aint in town
chorus
you gonna try to try harder cuz
try harder cuz
try trytrytry

verse 2
and the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin is fresher
than most of these rappers running the game
certain people will copy whats in the past to turn the profit with cash
theres time i would have done it the same
i mean i got me a range
also got me a guilty conscience
that made you tell anybody i meet that i rent
sometimes i wish that i would just chilled on the sneakers
and watched the game from the bleachers
because im really tend to need what i spent
in a house that i promised to get my mother dont compensate for the other time
i wasted out late at the club
instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner im working hard on the winter
so this album is a labor of love
you say as long as im staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats
that she can rest without a toss and a turn
because she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on tv
thats exactly why i often get burned
but im gonna try to

So Aubrey, show these people what you got man!

196,Intro (Comeback Season),"[Spoken Word: Drake]
You see the difference between me and you: is that I just hit rock bottom. After this, I don't have a choice. I got people to provide for, promises I've made, and goals to meet. Hmm. What you got?Comeback",
197,The Presentation,"[Produced By Rich Kidd]

[Verse 1]
Shake up the world, that is what I'm about to do
And homie, you ain't even on my altitude
I'm tellin you, I got enough cloud for two
And like a nigga turned Blood, I came out the blue
They like, ""Damn who's Drake, where's wheelchair Jimmy at?""
On my Chris Brown shit, I'm still here, gimme that
I'm cutting lights out like it's bedtime
These other rappers lukewarm like red wine
The truth hurts so please don't rub it in
I'm not signed yet, so I'm still budgeting
I'm like Jeopardy, I'm still buzzin in
Every city that you got a nephew or a cousin in
I miss cake these days
I can't even afford a mistake these days
All of my favorite girls miss Drake these days
Please don't take offense to my ways
Cause I need drug money Who got drug money?
I am talkin ""white Phantom sittin' on dub"" money
I am talkin ""cold champagne at the club"" money
And no I ain't emotional, but baby I love money
To all these A&R's that's playin' stars
Why you gotta act dumb? (dumb)
Your girl know how I beat it like a flat drum
And spit dirty like I'm chewing on black gum
I fooled y'all, ain't shit for me to come back from
[Interlude]
Oh! Yes!
I'd like to take this opportunity
To formally welcome you to this extravaganza
That I call Comeback Season
Hope you enjoy your stay
Drinks are on me, by the way, yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
How the fuck Jay and Dame gon' break up 'fore they meet Drake?
I'm sure it can be resolved, I'm just hopin that they make up
I'm perfecting my craft using more cess
Tryna make some cheese off a single is a process
Get it? Kraft, single, cheese, process
Sit back and admire the talent that I possess
Top notch, no less, oh yes, I'm known in the city
But need to bust out like a model that show chest
Cause you deal with agents from check collections
I'm keepin' it cleaner than Little X direction
And baby girl, if you don't like me, it's prolly due to the fact
That you are les like NextSelection
The city is mine, I control this, you know this
Cause you are nothing like it and I'm so this, the coldest
I'm in Jamaica, docked at the bay, what up Otis?
I'm back with the form like Obus, I go, yeah
And I'mma teach it so you learn right
You can't come on this ride, you need to earn height
With no hydro bill, I let the lights burn out
And after that I take 'em back like returned flights, yeah
You can't miss the boy
Me and Rich united like van Nistelrooy
Bar Mitzvah kid, get your hits destroyed
Cause I keep it under wraps like Christmas toys
No witnesses, no mistresses
This the present and I'm a show you what gifted is, mayne
Keep it real, no other youngin's as hot as me
You a Gucci groupie, my nigga, and I'm a prodigy
What I'm direct for, cause I'm who they check for
I waited for connects while you was playin' Connect Four
You was playin' Uno, I was doing you know
Whatever us rappers do to develop a new flow, I promise

198,Comeback Season,"[Produced by Nottz]

[Verse]
I got ice all over my windshield
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter
I hit the defrost, I never turn the heat off
And still I'm so chilly willy snowflake
These silly billies really fail to act as if they know Drake
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryin' to explain
How I am no good, so go with the next man, but dog
You don't know me, you don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F, and any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and I spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out, nigga I am not playin'
Just fall back, keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team
Not us, so you knock us, that's precisely what I mean
And dog, it's forever clear, my money evergreen
My presence required in places you have never been
It's all in a day's work, that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And whose Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel on the curb, ticket on the dash
It's like every fuckin' summer I just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity, none of them as hot as me
The industry standard, so I am what they gotta be
Cause Drake's syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it, I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pendant
You ain't livin', rapper, you never have been
You a has-been, a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey, you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air, I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire, and gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this summer, I did it prior
I've shattered shows in tattered clothes
Met status quos, this is the South
And I am, present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl, don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom, they always ask me, ""Is that a rose?""
""You mean Rosé? Why yes it is""
I stopped trying years ago, this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style, you're in need of ya own, man",
199,Closer to My Dreams,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time
Like what it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then but, probably tell you a lil' somethin' now

[Verse 1: Drake]
Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin'
I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels
And they silencing you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track
Well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch blue and green diamonds I call it the Earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years it's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap it's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' drinks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like [Andreena harmonizes]
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring '07 second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is wack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at a dinner table
And say ""My baby's famous and I knew it"" (yeah)
And it wasn't nothin' to it
I've drawn it and drew it 'til the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out
[Drake Talking]
Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF (uhh)
Miss Andreena Mill

[Chorus: Andreena Mill]
Closer to my dreams I'm gettin' higher
Yeah I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progressed
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video
Which made everything right with X (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
Far too many rappers and not enough ___
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
Day care play pen drop out
To grade ten drop out
To summer '05 with the grey Benz drop out
Charcoal Charger
Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the Artful Dodger
Shola Ama
I told her I'mma
'Bout to get my run on so hold the commas
Times've changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And ""Hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest""
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive

200,Replacement Girl,"[Intro: Trey Songz]
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement

[Verse 1: Drake & Trey Songz]
Let me show you what it is
I was birthed up top but was raised at the bottom of the map
Where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap
If you lookin' for the good then we got 'em in the trap like, ooh wee
Took 'em from white sneaks to Louis
This metaphor might sound a little confusin' but
Y'all don't really know me if you know me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I done come all way from the Days Inn
And all the hotels that I stayed in
And I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good
And now I say it's sittin' at amazin'
Girls tryna SoHo lobby us
Hear 'em all screamin' then it's probably us
But I can't blame females
Females can't really ignore somethin' this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town?
Two or three days, I shut you down
Chilin' with the homie Trey Songz
You call him the prince, he rep two up, two down
Anyone I know get used to me
I'm far from the man that I used to be
And I don't ever really kick game
I know you find it impressive whenever you introduced to me
'Cause I'm a good dude who take pride in that
Need good lovin' I'm providin' that
Understand that I'm worldwide, you get it how you want it wherever you be residin' at
'Cause I do things from the M-town
To the UK and from Spain back out to Texas
This album's for my fans, but, yo, this hook is for my exes

This one is for you girl, you know who you are girl
You only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it
Girl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you
You had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you
Oh, you had a man now you don't, now you don't
Back to the basics, I think I made it
Ladies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Ain't ya never seen a youngin' so fly? (Probably not)
Lookin' for someone your type
I done left behind the love of my life (She gone)
Tryna find another one tonight
And if it's you baby, let yourself be seen
Don't matter skirts, dresses or jeans
I got that work, know what I mean
And I'm flexin' on my ex if you know what I mean

201,City Is Mine,"[Verse 1]
This the record that my backpack underground fans get to skippin'
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin'
Chasin' fat stacks, runnin' down grands and submission
I don't back track, every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice, I just got clean rap
I don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin' beside's all bossed up
Burglar minded they say I'm servin' them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater, uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow
Peep though, when I get fed up, it’s sped up
Riding through the streets, just reclining in my seat hoe
Uh, them city lights is looking brighter, its 3 a.m. in the morning An' the pen is like a lighter
I’m just a writer flaming pages of a notebook, my Rachel McAdams get At ‘em when I ignite her
Yup, soon as a couple plan a trip, you smell gasoline I’m burning All up and down the strip, strip
I done said it, I give you the unleaded, just tip me, if your tank Is empty come get me
[Hook]
Yo, the city is mine  (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!

[Verse 2]
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose
There's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but
You got a debt and you choose not to pay that
I'mma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh
I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
This ain't last year, money like a cashier
So hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin' on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy

peep though when i get fed up it’s sped up
riding through the streets just reclining in my seat hoe
uh them city lights is looking brighter its 3 am in the morning an the pen is like a lighter
i’m just a writer flaming pages of a notebook my rachel mcadams get at ‘em when i ignite her
yup soon as a couple plan a trip you smell gasoline i’m burning all up and down the strip strip
i done said it i give you the unleaded just tip me if your tank is empty come get me
hook
yo the city is mine  which one
toronto
drake thats me
you know how the story goes
pull up range rove yo chick wanna roll
and i play myself in the stereo
and i make em wanna
shake shake it drop it drop it
bounce it bounce it wop it wop it
girl move that thang like you gettin money for college go
shake shake it drop it drop it
bounce it bounce it wop it wop it
girl move that thang like you gettin money for college go

verse 2
break it down like you working for your tuition at howard
mama get it how you live that thang that you working is power
tryna be generous so honey heres a tip
nowadays its gettin cheaper to put 20s on the whip
so if you a opportunist look for 20s in the clip
and if you find em attractive and funny thats when you dip dip
and its a trip my city broke into sections
up north i got me a couple of troubles couple connections
and its nothing that i created on purpose
theres people that gotta problem
but they scared to let it surface uh
ya boy say this that and the third to em
see me out and they never utter a word to em
expect me not to draw a card from the deck
anybody in my city going hard i respect but
you got a debt and you choose not to pay that
imma hop ya fence come into your yard and collect lect uh
it aint a problem of concern bruh
i always end up with exactly what i earn bruh
this aint last year money like a cashier
so hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
yessir i live in a city where a lot of people dont get shine shine
and i be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line line
and i got way too much love for the city i can never get too much of
and if anybody hatin on me i deport em the city is mine boy
"
202,Barry Bonds (Freestyle),"[Verse]
It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it?
Your weekly entertainment
For me to get a hold of this beat and go 'head, claim it
I'm about to paint a picture, you niggas go 'head, frame it
Since we getting Seinfeld on some Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from mediocre
And if we talking cards, I will fold him with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck of 54
So it's obvious y'all gon' steady be rolling with some jokers
And me, I'm rolling with some brokers
Like, damn, could you niggas get any broker?
I got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the embarrassment, don't even approach her
Disguise yourself, go buy a costume
I am making stocks work while you working stock rooms
Ugh, and I was praying I would drop June
But label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rocking for Pete's sakes
You fake gangsta rappers are cliché
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet Drake
I'll be all in your face, like, ""No speak-a la ingles""
Soon as you hear it, you quote it
They try to be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me, I'm aware, and my car's right there
Is this interior enough for y'all ulterior motives?
'Cause if you like it, y'all should stick with me
My money good, I ain't never had to flip a ki
A lot of ice, a lot of cream like Dickie Dee
Might cut the phone and disapear like Michie Mee
But I'ma try and have you on the trip with me
Sliding through Henri Bendel like it's slippery
And your ex-man is a hater, officially
Probably 'cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he be
Yeah, that's the reason why he looking hard
'Cause I done snatched the Chips Ahoy out the cookie jar
He just mad 'cause his girl's at the house
With her tongue sticking out like a Michael Jordan rookie card
Let me address this, pardon me while I fix
A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought he could've been Gotti in the flicks
But at this point, I'm just poking a body with a stick
Nowadays, rapping is a children's hobby
And girls keep telling me I'm still this snobby
I tell them myself is who I am feeling, probably
Just because I got a buzz like a building lobby
It ain't a song that your ass finna skip
I tried to sell weed, give me cash for the zip
The way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car
Seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip
Millionaire shades, fade with the waves
I smirk at a nigga if he still rocking braids
That just lets me know that we ain't on the same page
And that goes out to every nigga except Trey
I'm outta here, baby
They asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
I wouldn't take it back, nah, not if they paid me
Mr. Bet You That's Expensive 'cause it's not a fugazi
Spitting a Crock Pot of bottomless gravy
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasting?
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's
Forget it, girl, they just thinking how to replace me
Exit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope
You took that 'Ye beat and put that shit in a choke
Well, I'm thinking I should leave out on this note
Nigga, keep your two cents, I ain't tryna leave you broke
[Refrain]
Life of a don, lights keep glowing
Come up in the club with that fresh shit on
And something crazy on my arm, uh-ahem
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds",
203,Going in for Life,"[Verse]
I don't think they really ready for my wardrobe
I show up right before the store close
And blow the fee from my last four shows
I do one song and use four flows
She used to be a Christian before
Now, all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes
Like, ""Baby, those are cute, I adore those""
Me and the salesman build a rapport so
He understand the fact that I'm spending offshore dough
Cash-only transactions, homie
And please, no receipts—the feds like to explore those
They can't audit if they dont know I bought it
Been doing it for years, homie; thoroughly, I thought it...
Through, what it do? I am currently recording on a track
Admitting most of my currency’s imported
But too late now, it's too legitimate to hit 'em with...
A lawsuit, even if those are acts that I did commit
Repeat offender, Anita Baker playing in the whip
As they pull me over, ""my sweet surrender""
I got a Jewish lawyer as my lead defender
A Menschkeit, as they say; he’s a legal bender
And ATF is present, every regal member
The coalition is so efficient
You have to be invited, or there's no admission
We know tradition, we spend money
So don't try to compete if you in no position
I wish you would listen
I take you back to this trial
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition
My foot is just solely fit for this shoe it fits in
Used to record in the basement that Renny grew his piff in
When Pops turned over keys like a new ignition
If Hov is Jordan, I guess I'm cool with Pippen
'Til I mention that I wanna play a new position
No team-playing, no screen-setting
""Because I wanna win games, Coach, I'm through assisting""
The takeover, the break's over, nigga
And I'ma keep killing 'em until the day that Drake's over
The wait's over, the tape's coming
They bullshitting, but I am equipped with great plumbing
The human mentality, so eager to hate something
And try to play it off like it ain't jumping
And it's the predicament that you found Drake in
The condo that I just purchased sound vacant
'Cause I have just been sittin' in this cell
Thinking what I could've done to make my first video groundbreaking
And whenever I'm flowing on the mic
Aside from talking 'bout the D I'm throwing in your wife
I treat this one session as if it were my last
And I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for life, like that!",
204,Where to Now,"[Intro: Drake talking]
Okay...
There comes a time...
When you gotta be like
You know, I've come this far on my own, done a lot for myself
Where to now, you know?
But I just—I just tell myself this one thing

[Verse: Drake]
It was worth it, it was all worth it
And by this time, I understand that I ain't perfect
There ain't a pair of Louis shoes I ain't purchased
And I was on some shit, but they served they purpose
And I got verses, I got verses
My sixteens should be arriving in hearses
They get bodied, you see how I murk this
I switch flows much as my girl switch purses
Yeah, Heartbreak Drake, I'll put it on your wife
If I put it in a verse, then I put it on my life
Liquor that's over ice and denim that's overpriced
And tryna make all my goals for the future come overnight
Go—Go—Go—Goddamn, how time soars
I'm tryna get that house in Toronto with pine floors
Come over, watch a season of Flight of the Conchords
And I try to put some lotion all over your contours
But ugh, tell me you surfing, let me know you on board
You can't seal up the bottle once all of the Dom's poured
Yes, I swear to God, girl I put it on Lord
I'm tryna show you life through the tint on these Tom Fords
Ethiopian girl, Ethiopian girl
With your long, curly hair and yo' big ass boo-tay
Reading all them pro-Black, pro-female books
Just let 'em, let 'em know that you ain't no groupie
You need a prescription, a vision correction
I'm young and successful, I'm living perfection
And man, if '09 is when I'ma see mine
Being cool ain't enough, homie; I'ma freeze time, like that!","

205,Share,"[Hook (x3)]
Take what you want, take what you want
Take what you want, take what you want
But, you gotta share it with the world

[Verse: Drake]
Lately I've been murdering and avoiding conviction
This shit is like an addiction conflicting with what I do
Shout out to K Davis and my connect up at Avis
Cause every weekend I'm rollin' out stuntin' in somethin' new
Fortunately I am at an elevated level
I'm celebrated at home and
I am high above it all
But apologies to my fans that be super conscious
Just wait 'til I get my money right and
I am going to ball ball ball
[Hook]
Take what you want, take what you want
Take what you want, take what you want
But, you gotta share it with the world",
206,Give Ya,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Check, look
And I ain't tryna get to know nobody but you
Do me a favor tell me what's happenin'
I am drinkin' XO D is sippin' some Appleton
Usually the things I desire I always apprehend
Back again return of the mack again
'Deceiving' was cool I'll never record the track again
Even though my ex is fuckin' one of my rapper friends
I don't wanna seem like I am always attacking them verbally
You can stop frontin' I know you heard of me
Babygirl ya, ya, ya heard of me
Little me
Pay attention I guarantee you it'll be
One of the best, decisions you've made
I'm sonnin' them all I live in the shade
Previously mischievous behaviour was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin' out the house tryna figure out where cameras from Cheaters would be
But now I need a culprit
I am talkin Long Sands Beach, condo adult shit
I am talkin' all day shoppin' sprees in the mall with
Friends that I ball with
Hear me, Trey's girl? Go and get you some Fall shit
Sweetie I am a track's demise
I will kill this song 'til it actually dies
With a military jacket and some packed supplies
I won't say I'm the best 'til the stats arrive
And all these a-list parties you fraternize
Where you can't wear hats inside it's only slacks and ties
But you don't never act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy 'til the plaques arrive
And girl, I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint
Now it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint
I gave up a lot to make a progress
I give it to you, and you take it the best
[Chorus: Trey Songz]
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya
(You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
(It's The Prince, look here)
Yup it's me again, Songz with a 'z' again
Canadian visitor, lady exhibitor
Play me I'll visit ya
Lay you in critical, condition
So don't get it twisted nigga
But back to the pimpin' nigga
Intercontinental you can catch me laid up
Somethin' with a fly face, slim waist, big butt
That's why I love what I does
Shot a couple videos now we got the city froze
Somethin' like my wrist be
Niggas know how this shit be
Step into the club security never frisk me
Buy so much liquor they give us a couple sips free
I be on Hennessy, straight, no cubes
Take me where the women be, I won't lose
Drake take Patrón to the face 'til he wasted
I'm blowin 'til I'm gon' outta space in the Matrix
Call me Mr. Anderson huh
I'm ramblin'
But at the same time I'm spittin' a flame rhyme
Baby what's your name? They call me the game mind
Most valuable player baby listen it's game time
We could take a couple shots break down ya d's
Take it to the hole post up on me
Let me fill the arena, I'll be Gilbert Arenas
Somethin' like a wizard when I give ya what I give ya

207,Don’t You Have a Man,"[Chorus: Dwele & Drake]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl? (Yeah)
I can't believe it (I know you got a man)
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
It's all right with me, my girl
We can do anything (Kick it to you like this)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Why you over there looking at me
While your man standing right beside you?
The temporary happiness he might provide you
But you know and I know that nobody gon' do you like me
Tryna save you like a goalie in line-of-sight
I know that I feel her, but slowly, I'm kinda like
I don't really wanna hit this girl
And still, she want this chap's stick like Napoleon Dynamite
Well, I'ma give it to you, honeybunches
You feel it all under your ribs like some tummy crunches
All my other girls all up on that subtle shit
They don't wanna cut it, they want a rapper to cuddle with
Consequences keep weighin me down
So whenever she thinks I'm serious, I'm playing around
It gets deeper and colder, the funny thing is
I'm writing this in my head as she asleep on my shoulder, like...
[Chorus: Dwele]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
It's all right with me, my girl
We can do anything

[Verse 2: Big Pooh]
Look, we had a lil' thing, a wintertime fling
You some getback for your man mistreating
But that was then, you know, some hush-hush
I ain't never really see a future in us
Plus, your man still there, let's be fair
You'd do the same things to me
My feelings never did go past some late-nigh- smash
I'on't wanna take the place of he
Late nights, 85 South on my way to the crib
And somebody got a song for me
I already know what you about, 'cause I been the other man
And you not gonna trap me with your silly lil' plan
It's my bad, should've chose a wo-man
But I'm in the mix with this lil' girl, playing
I'm saying, you need to do what you do
I'm not tryna take it any further with you, c'mon

209,The Last Hope,"[Chorus: Andreena Mills]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope

[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]
Can you imagine the last breath of Christ?
The last breath of Christopher Wallace on that faithful night
The last step that Martin Luther took as a man
I got the power of my world in my hand
The Microphone brings life or death in the blink of an eye
I was born to provoke those born to die
I was conceived to beat all odds like Las Vegas
T-dot motherfucker, watch the world rape us
Greatest strugglers hustle to succeed
Cross water smugglers tussle to burn weed
It meets that pressure to success in the South
Niggas watching what I say magnifying my mouth
I never take back talk, I apply the force
Hand blistering from many years of holding the torch
When the skin rebuilds, it grows tougher than leather
So we can keep on hold it forever
My name's Kardinall
[Chorus: Andreena Mills]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope

[Verse 2: Drake]
Jealousy is something I haven't felt in years
There's nobody around for me to be jealous of
I bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers
Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love
Dawg, I'm incredible fuckin unforgettable, but when it comes to records I will eat it if it's edible
They say the futures always for-seen
That's why I'm steady getting more money more cream
My flow is stuck in the moment that comes before dreams
I stay avoiding unlucky like 14
And people get behind and they fight for em' cause he won't let no other niggas write for em'
And even when its quite warm, the attitude coursing through the veins and my city is an ice storm
The name's Drake and I don't take it for granted
I can take it you offended cause I'm taken advantage man

[Chorus: Andreena Mills]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me
But this time around they won't skip me
I am the last hope. Don't hesitate not even for a second
The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope","

210,Must Hate Money,"[Intro: Drake]
I've got it made thats what I'm talking about
Going down to the fashion store and get myself fitted out
Going down to the dealers buy myself a brand new car
So me and my lady can ride

[Verse 1: Drake]
Check, I wish y'all coulda seen me back in high school, backpack
Grey range black Ac'
Put a half a stack out just to get a stack back
Double that school dance, Fresh J's, new pants
Back when ""fuck bitches, get money"" was the new chant
It started out about a boy like Hugh Grant
Now I'm a young man doin things you can't
But you can't call me Champagne Charlie
I campaign hardly
My damn chain glitter ruby red
The type of shit that leave your hand stained scarlet
I live it, thought you knew this
I swear that we been through this
Your boyfriends future plans got 'em on todays to-do list
Cause he rollin wit more squares then you would find up on a rubix
Bingo, money ain't a thing ho
That prometh with that sprite and jolly rancher so flamingo
I ain't speaking in code real niggas they know the lingo
Cause when I'm in the spot it's popping like Christopher's single
[Chorus: Drake]
If ya'll don't like me then (you must hate money, money)
Guaranteed if you had it to spare you could probably comprehend I'm just sayin' man (you must hate money, money)
They be gettin' jealous when you paid, savin' everything they made, I keep thinkin' that (you must hate money, money)
Telling people my image is lame, and I'm whats wrong with the game, but I'm feelin' like (you must hate money, money)
Considering everywhere I go got couple grand to blow man you know

[Verse 2: Rich Boy]
Hey, I'm flyer then a motherfucker
Haters wanna see me dead like John Tucker(so)
I'm in that big boy 550 s-class
I hit the gas and watch them hoes waving through the glass
Pimp glass im riding new in 2008 (say what)
I hit them hoes and send em home, you take em on a date
That white gucci ticker let em know there's money here
I grip the grain and sit on seats thats made of cashmere
5 karats in my ear, you see them hoes jock?
Bitch theres a whole lota rocks up in this powder watch
I'm writin letters to the pen for my brother irving
Send him a picture of that drop with me in it swervin
Hotter than a bitch rock, Cooler than some ice cream
Gotta feed myself I'm up here living in a dream
My cadillac mean but my 88 a beast
If bein fly against the law bitch call the po-lice

[Chorus: Drake]
If ya'll don't like me then (you must hate money, money)
Guaranteed if you had it to spare you could probably comprehend I'm just sayin' man (you must hate money, money)
They be gettin' jealous when you paid, savin' everything they made, I keep thinkin' that (you must hate money, money)

211,Asthma Team,"I swear to you Lord
Same dudes used to laugh at me
See me in the CL 6 with Haffa B
They know that money begets money so naturally
Me and Haffa could blow a couple of stacks hassle free
I'm like fuck y'all haters on behalf on me
Cause I could flood the city with a staff of three
I'm talking me and two part -ners in that Caprice
With no copies made I got the master keys
And fast cars, fast women, fast cash and cream
Could mould you rappers like plasticine
I have to dream, but dog
Me and success are two things you don't wanna find your ass between
*Back against the wall like a plasma screens*
The inside of my wallet is pasture/ past your green
And you are now hanging with the asthma team
Sweetie catch your breath while I smash the scene
I should leave Earth, nothing left to do here
Everyday is Christmas and e'ry night is New Year's
Say whatever, I never been concerned about who hears
Call my town Sparta and I'm coming with two spears
I'm telling you dog, always got the spring collection in fall
I run my bill up making executives calls
And with me, women be building these sceptical walls
But once you slept with one dime man, you slept with them all, uhh
Family, money, and music is all I ever knew
My necklace suffer from depression it's forever blue
Cheer up baby you don't see all this revenue?
I started the game at level two
I'm sayin'
Stop acting like teen girls are my only market
I parallel the Flying +Spur+ +Tony park+ it
And it's cool if you spill suttin it's only carpet
That's why I get my interior colour only dark shit
Toronto's where you livin' today
And you ain't making records that people are driven to play
I would advise you to really make a move, sooner than later
Cause these are only the joints that I'm giving away
You feel me?",
212,Do What You Do (Remix),"[Intro: Drake]
I do this for ya'll man
Malice, Nickelus F, it's the REMIX!

[Verse 1: No Malice]
Lights slow motion, steppin' out the Phantom
All eyes on me, peekin' and glancin'
Leanin' on the wall, with b-boys dancin'
Ears, neck, and wrists lookin' like the king's ransom
One chick, each arm, makin' it a tandem
Flat here costing' like fifty grand standard
Bottles poppin', cars wit' options
We livin' like kings, homie, you just watchin'
And I'm a show for ya, marble flo' for ya
And that thing in the driveway, came with the spoiler
I ain't bluffin', cop jewels off the Russian
Diamonds in the Jesus, look like he's blushin'
Miami breezes, we cross seasons
Escaped indictments, thank you Jesus
Y'all haters ain't even got a clue
While we get this paper, and that's how we do
[Bridge]
R-E U-P G-A-N-G
R-E U-P G-A-N-G

[Chorus: Drake]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Verse 2: Drake]
Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you
And I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just noticed me now but I was here all along
Your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed I live this, you ask me what the business
And I write a sixteen and report it
The waiting is over I think music need it
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude
They expectations I'mma exceed it
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish
Finally here I'mma star with the timing
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining
This for anybody that's searchin for cash, and purchasing fast
You only get the dough when you grindin
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming, boy!

213,Easy to Please,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, look

[Verse 1: Drake]
Me and Sos, we from two different walks of life
Mutually we understand there's a problem, we don't talk to vice
The watch is yellowy-green
That's sum awkward ice
I never signed for a mill' but been offered twice
I'm awful nice, lyrics that I often write
Inspire no-talent rappers to get off the mic
And I could pick you up from work when you get off tonight
Drop you at the house soon as you get off the pipe, man
I flow so cool like autumn nights
When I body this, tell me if the coffin's light
But don't try and tell me that a dolphin's white
Mislead Drake, that is not at all polite
It's a shame cause that's how the biz goes
Imagine if these other niggas flop and his blows
Bet I get a co-sign somethin' like no time
They'll be tryna sub a nigga in like Quizno's
[Chorus: Richie Sosa & Drake]
All I need is some weight, my scale, some money for bail
A lil' booth at the club for the whole cartel
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
And somethin' heavy on my waist man, I'm easy to please
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua
The whole ATF you know who we are
My women, my money, and leave me the keys
Of somethin fast and I'm good man I'm easy to please

[Verse 2: Richie Sosa]
I never lived in a fancy house
I grew up where the guns pop and the child molesters pulled the candy out
So I never really had a chance to escape
Fast forward to '07, ain't nothin' much changed
The D still scope the crip
And the mics ain't really that much bigger than the roaches is
And told the same damn sad story, different publishin'
D boys jugglin', single mother strugglin'
The media try to cover it
But the Cottonelle two-ply in your neighbor's house, I'm on some other shit
Me and Drake from two different walks of life
But both understand the pressure from the sharks that bite
My left arm's like David Wells
My right arm's like Holliday, so I'm probably lookin' at 8 to 12
For just tossin' one of my close friends a bag of chips
Shit, I know they want me locked up

214,Faded,"[Intro: Drake]
Please

[Verse 1: Drake]
D-d-d-d-damn what did I consume
Something spinnin' fast either me or it's the room
I bet you it's the room, cause I don't do no drugs
Or maybe it's that 'tron cause I sure do have a buzz
Baby either way I'm throwed and I am on a mission
So if your ears a virgin I'd advise you not to listen
Cause this shit isn't kosher and this shit isn't Christian
It's that motherfuckin' heat you can find up in the kitchen
Baby holla at your nigga, I got that shit for low
Okay maybe I don't but guarantee someone I know
Wait let me slow it down (down) I'm gettin' ahead (head)
Plus it's gettin' hot so I'm a take a seat instead (stead)
I'm lucky I ain't dead (dead) I'm on a rollercoaster ride y'all
We all of age and I ain't got nothin' to hide y'all
And in this game I'm a tidal when the tides small
So drop me in and I release just like a time bomb
[Chorus: Drake]
Every record that I've done, the station here they play it
This the city that I run, this the shit that I created
They tellin' me I'm the one and I haven't even made it
Maybe I'm hearing things cause I'm feeling like I'm faded
I'm feelin' like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
F-faded f-faded
I'm feelin' like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded

[Verse 2: Nickelus F]
I just set the 40 ups, and I got two blunts
Bagging sour diesel, stinking like I got a few stumps
I’m sipping on lean, while you got fruit punch
Getting faded like clothes, I’ve been washed too much
Man, smoking with the devil got me high as an angel
Blow a smoke ring over my head, it’s a halo
Wake up, and bake up, spend the whole day slow
Head in the clouds, but my face low
Ayo, I got them percocets, you want a percocet?
Yo' girl got some nice titties, yeah, a perky set
I purchase cess ‘cause everyday I work with stress
High while I’m driving, it’s like I’m triyn’ to work a jet
And I smoke like a choo-choo train
So I stay low-key like Ja Rule new name
And I can barely walk, but it’s all good and dandy
Man, I’m so high I need a pilot to land me

216,Think Good Thoughts,"[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
9th Wonder
Don't judge me, man
They tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
They say we lack substance
Me, 'Te and El 'bout to prove 'em wrong, though

[Chorus: Drake]
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
[Verse 1: Drake]
They don't be saying how I'm humble, I'm hella nice
Or that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
They just tell you all the rumors they heard
And we laugh soon as you come and tell me like Amel and Bryce
My groove theory is that when you too cheery
They try to bring you down to the level they at
Well when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
That's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
But, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart, girl
Nah, they probably think I'll break your heart, girl
Haha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
And if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound
I mean I spit that influential shit from my town
I don't know why you sitting on the couch
When you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
You think taking your purse off
Will lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
At least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
And you probably would've been worse off
So I'ma take this hat off, and I'ma hit it till I'm back soft
And then I backs off
'Cause you thinking you can predict what happen
You the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping

217,Teach U a Lesson (Freestyle),"[Verse 1: Drake]
Me and you so crucial baby
And that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you ain't use to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
When raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy
That's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
When you are wet and covered in sweat
I'll wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
I love all my feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at
If it's over fast then I promise you will relapse
Forget what you guess that I'm on and who is in your past
I'm refreshing and grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you lets us girl, I'mma bring the dressing along
You hear that professional tone?
Half of that's ice and the rest is Patron
Show up on time for the class I'm teaching
Cause guaranteed I'mma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring the breastes along
Instead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
I confess this address to you
And I'm the post man looking for a slot I can put it in
With no New York number mom still upstairs
I'm two floors under but my room's sound proof
You so tempted to satisfy your urge so you don't wonder
Yeah
I know I told you before I'll grab that for ya like holding a door
'Cause mine's it Polo and yours is Vickie
And they just spread all over the floor like
[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
You feel so good
You smell so good
You feel so warm
Just like I knew you would
Can't let you go
Can't let you go
I can't let you go

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right up
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you
Someone's gonna have to teach you

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
You can call me professor
But baby, you broke the rules
You won't get the grade you want

218,Missin’ You (Freestyle),"[Intro: Trey Songz]
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no

[Verse 1: Drake]
Nah
I never needed advice about
All the things you liked to do when it was lights out
I drove nice cars, I got a nice house
But now I'm steady missing you like a strikeout
I always wished I would've cared more
That's my only feeling inside whenever I get a song done
I'm scared that every girl I care for
Will find a better man and end up happier in the long run
Ya, and when she not by my side
And I hear that she gone
Now it's like a shock to my pride
I don't care if she know
'Cause that's basically just a male ego
Speaking aloud to some real people
But you can bounce back
Go ladies
More records, more sex, more babies
Yeah, wanna grant one of my wishes
Tired missing you, I'm tryna make you a missus
[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
I miss the way you kiss
I miss the way you wear them heels and make it switch
Miss the way ya hair blows in the wind
And I miss you staying here till the morning
Miss the way you put on your makeup
Miss the way you love me too much
It's everything about you baby
Wanna know where you been lately
Do you go out? Do you still live at your old house?
Do you got somebody new in your life?
'Cause I can't get you outta my mind

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
And every girl I try to replace you with
Why can't I get over it?
Simply 'cause I can't

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I can't stop missing you (Can't Stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no

219,Man of the Year,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
Think I had the motherfucking plan of the year
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers
And I get my girl whatever she desire
And my niggas get whatever they require
These rappers old, I’m the reason they expire
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah
Damn, that punch line was predictable
I still got you shitting bricks, homie quit the bull
And we don’t need new members, to me the clique is full
And I be getting the same women that Tip can pull
Believe or not, I receive a lot
So I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got
And I be buying the Louis that Kanyeezy cop
And I be ripping the same records that Weezy rock
This shit is easy pop
That’s why I’m ready man
I’d never copy Nor-bit like Eddie man
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit
Or was it way over your head, did you forfeit?
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick
Her ass big, she just trying to make a four fit
Yeah, they need to issue out a recall
I’m going up and they heading into a freefall
The fundamentals are needed, you playing streetball
And I was out at BET, but I didn’t see ya’ll
These Skee-Lo rappers wishing they could be tall
Letting all their fake friends use them like a free stall
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
My shades so dark and my ice so bright
My buddy in my pants wanna fight your wife
Like, round one, round two, round three
I told you not to ever bring a bitch ’round me
Cause, ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
No, ain’t no nigga like me
Ya dig

[Verse 2: Drake]
I said I know you see me chilling super low key
If I’m with the right niggas, you can scoop an O.Z
All the hustlers and the bouncers and the groupies know me
Fresh denim, fresh shades in a coupe with no keys
It start up when I touch the door
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor
As soon as we finish cutting, we can cut some more
Then after you get high
Make em, get em, girl you finna get low
Lights dimmed down
Got a lota dough plus a hit sound
What you mean you ain’t heard? I come highly recommended
Everybody my friend even if they been offended
They ain’t really got a choice, it’s an obvious decision
You tryna make a come up in my city, it’s a given
Plus a nigga famous, plus I got a vision
Not to mention having bars like a motherfucking prison
They taking too long, their records on hold
They threatened by my presence cause I make them feel old
Guaranteed if they drop, they bragging bout what they sold
Just remember where I live at, fifty thousand's going gold
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known
Instead of hatin’ on my music in the comfort of your home
Nigga, be a man, you acting like a bitch
I ain’t acting like I’m rude
I’m just acting like I’m rich, rich
Riding with Weezy fucking Baby
Are you the type of girl that me and Weezy fucking, baby?
Cause I don’t waste time, can’t you see a nigga lazy
And I might need some help
But, you know, Weezy’s fucking crazy

220,New Shit,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Check (Nottz, Nottz, Nottz)
They ask me about this rapper chick I might know
I say I never hit it but we sure to try it right though
My verses smother beats and they are in need of some lipo
As for rappers, she is not my type, she's like a typo
Flow is universal, take a blood test, I'm type-O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, it's quite low
I write so, I might blow, my chain emits a white glow
See life is a scrimmage I am runnin' the ISO
What is about to unfold, no tellin' like a dice throw
Meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
It's only if she's nice though, I ain't about the wife though
And let no, Uncle Ben's rice throw, that is just how my life go
And move faster than the leopard sprint
Around the world, got a lot of spots like leopard print
I used to think you play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby
[Chorus: Drake]
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around

[Verse 2: Von Pea]
It's been a couple weeks out travelin' and this broad
I've seen a couple freaks out battlin' for discharge it's odd
I try to tell her I ain't seen a flier one
Denying some, I have desired some, but that time is done
Now I am gon' give it to you straight out of the bottle
No chaser, I've embraced one in lace, she was a model
Shorty jumped out of the closet even though I mean literal
Her girl made it figurative, or maybe that's what liquor do
Baby, that's the physical, maybe if we spend
A few days all alone on our throne I can get to you
I know you feelin' hittin' on the road is the typical
But I be in the telly, on your Myspace clickin' through
Your pictures, this bruh took a good game
But a fella couldn't Roc, I wanna Dash to my Dame
I'm sayin', I know I be playin' too much
But I'd rather go deaf than loose touch, holla at me

221,Lust for Life,"[Verse]
I'm tryna do it all tonight, I got plans
I got a certain lust for life and as it stands
Everything is going as right as it can
They tryna shoot down my flight before it lands, before it lands
But you could miss me with all that
Diss me, then crawl back
I really wish y'all would fall back
But gettin' rich s'posed to solve that
And these days, women make offers
And who the hell am I to say (No, no, no)?
My ex sendin' late night texts
'Cause she don't know how to let (Go, go, go)
Uh, she in love
And as for them pretty light-skinned models
Standin' in the cold, ah, yeah, they with us
Let them girls in for a drink and I'm all in they ear
Sayin' she should be the one I see every time that I'm here
But when am I really even here?
Black Suburban with the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old handprints on it
But I'mma be the one to pour cement on it
Uh, and start over
And show up in a Margiela tux, I don't really give a fuck
And we only gettin' older
So what I tend to do is to think of today as the past
It's funny when you comin' in first, but you hope that you last
You just hope that it last

One time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch

[Verse 1]
Up so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl, say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm, the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
'Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it
[Verse 2]
And I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Airport stunting, flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'ma sip this drank until that muhfucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on

[Chorus]
I don't give you the time you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight, I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Taking everything slow, so slow, so slow
But I do it to her

[Bridge]
Draped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end

Ayy, yeah
I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation, you know
I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 PM and you just rolling through the city
Bumping that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feel like, like everything's just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm gone",

It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find nowadays it's, you know, best to keep quiet
But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion, you know what it is

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes, rosé and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder
Private flights back home, no stop over
Still spittin' that shit that they shot Pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm the Group of Seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'ma do it reppin', I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyein' me all hard
And lyin' to they girls and drivin' the same cars
Sittin' there wishin' their problems became ours
‘Cause we have nothin' in common since I done became star
I done became bigger, swervin', writin' in my peers' lane
Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name
One touch, I could make the drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out, baby, word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers
My song is your girlfriend's waking-up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn' if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
'Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figure
How to get these label heads to offer him good figures
And me doin' the shows gettin' everyone nervous
'Cause them hipsters gon' have to get along with them hood niggas
It's all good, I'm goin' off like lights when the show's over
Make pasta, rent a movie, call hoes over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger, but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on your table, nigga; no coaster
Burn bread everyday, boy; no toaster
G and Tez got a SIG, but I'm no smoker
They just handin' chips to me, nigga; no poker
I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier
My cup runneth over
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit
D-R., CJ, and Po, I see y'all
These cases don't work out, I hope we can agree on
Makin' enough to pay any Judge Judy off
First thing I'ma do is free Weezy, go
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And I'd take probation
I don't want that T.I. and Vick vacation
Private plane, pick location
I'm goin' to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard
And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime you can call me young Roy
Jones Jr. fightin' the drugs and gun charge
Shit, don't leave me unguarded
And I'm a cheesehead, word to Vince Lombardi
Word to Marky Mark, leave a snitch departed
All that blood like the Red Sea parted
My gun go crazy like it's retarded
Red light on it like it's recording
I ain't recordin', I'm just C-4in'
My currency foreign; we are in a league they aren't
Better dig in your pocket and pay homage
Better cover your eyes, your face fallin'
Watch the game from the side, I'm play callin'
No, I didn't say that I'm flawless
But I damn sure don't tarnish
My pistol got comments for your garments
I'm so high I can vomit on a comet
K-Y, no homo, I'm on it
Weezy F Baby, new born bitch
You know what they say 'bout when your palm itch
I'm gon' get money, money I'm gon' get
Young Money in your tummy and we gon' shit
And get that toilet paper quick, like when Bones spit
That's right, bitch, I'm back on my grown shit
That Audemars Piguet, no ice, just chrome shit
And your boyfriend softer than a foam pit
I scream, ""Fuck the world with a long dick!""
Motherfucker, I'm me! Yeah, bitch, I'm me!
You niggas sweet, like the pussy in which I eat
Fireman burn down your entire street
So fly I'ma take off when I leap
Bye! And you can suck my wings
Stand on my money, headbutt Yao Ming
Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things
I'm shufflin' the cards, 'bout to cut my queens
But I ain't the dealer
House full of bitches like Tila Tequila
Yeah, I'm the man in the mirror
My swagger just screamin', motherfucker, do you hear her?
Yeah, Drizzy Drake what the lick read?
We make magic, boy; Roy and Siegfried

227,A Night Off,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Spending every moment in the studio
I never said it'd be fair
But when you're all alone, I hope you truly know
How bad I want to be there

[Chorus: Drake]
Come right in, set your bag down
Took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do, oh
Know you hate explaining how you want it done
Just be quiet, I'll do fine without your help, girl
Can you work without a second for some fun?
Now you finally got a moment to yourself, girl
And I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
[Verse 2: Lloyd]
I been waiting for so long to get you all alone
Now I finally got you right here
So, baby, I'ma lock my door and disconnect my phone
'Cause I wanna make one thing clear
I want you on top, so let your hair down
I took the night off for you
Girl, I'm gonna turn the lights off, but keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what we're about to do

[Chorus: Drake & Lloyd]
Come right in, set your bag down
I took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do, oh
Know you hate explaining how you want it done
Just be quiet, I'll do fine without your help, girl
Can you work without a second for some fun?
Now you finally got a moment to yourself, girl
And I know what to do with it

228,Say What’s Real,"[Verse: Drake]
Why do I feel so alone?
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if he acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart
To give these bitch niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back, but
It's hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets, showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camera, someone gotta tape this
And make hits like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness, I'm that close
Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
Watchin' Hov's show, embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out
So I park about five houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is, accounts in the minus
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters try to get me out to they club
And say I have fun but I can't imagine how
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl, standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear, we from a small town
And everybody talks and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something that these labels can't buy
Especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez, ""Damn, Drake fly""
And he just be like, ""Silly motherfucker, I know
That was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em?
He just take them records and he gas up on 'em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em""
Oh, they did, Po, at least they tried to
And that's what happen when you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you however they decide to
Nah, but 40 told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest, coulda fooled me
Boy, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy
Understand, I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit, I'm gettin' better still
Little niggas put my name in they verses
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said, ""'Cause this 'Ye shit, you better kill""
And I think this got this Making-of-a-Legend feel
Problem with these other niggas, they ain't never real
[Outro]
Yeah, that's all I can say",
229,Little Bit,"[Verse 1: Drake & Lykke Li]
Hands down, I'm too proud for love
But with eyes shut, it's you I'm thinkin' of
But how we move from A to B, it can't be up to me
'Cause you don't know who I was before you
And basically, to see a change in me
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah
Oh, but you're on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
Oh, but maybe in time in time, in time, I'll tell you I'm

[Chorus: Drake]
A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
[Verse 2: Drake & Lykke Li]
I know you told me break their hearts
But it's you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first, to say it
But still I, they know I
I would do it, push a button
Pull a trigger, climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff 'cause you're my baby
I love you, love you, a little bit
I would do it, you would say it
You would mean it, we could do it
It was you and I and only I, mmm

[Chorus: Lykke Li]
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit
Little bit in love with me

[Verse 3: Drake]
I hope they never find out
What they already know, know, know
As soon as it's official
We'll have to let it go, go, go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson
The pressure's on, both hearts beat like a metronome
Both in sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but it's just, so wrong
I wonder where my world 'bout
When niggas that I know tryna take my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just jealous cause you always get approached more
Oh well, tell her fall back
Caught up in some more shit, tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheatin on her ass
Wit a girl that I know, yeah tell her all, that, that
And as for you, I think I know you're the one
The closest I've come, I'm probably a

hands down im too proud for love

Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on

You don't even trip when friends say

231,Unstoppable,"[Verse 1: Drake]
My name is Drizzy, and I ain't perfect
But I work hard, so I deserve it
And I belong, right where you see me
Ain't on the fence about it, I ain't Mr. Feeny
Nah, I got a decent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or a planner
And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour
Who dress like Sarah Jessica and live like Princess Diana
So often they have addictions and I'm the one that'll feed it
But truly you're bad enough that y'all don't even really need it
You could show up at the party on dirty public transit
And I guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin' candids
Of you and your posse partyin', drinkin' what you get handed
With your Virgin Island tans, all lookin' like you just landed
I don't really understand it, I'm not sure I'm comprehendin'
But these girls are having fun with whoever's money they spendin', screamin'
[Chorus: Santigold]
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ahem, my name is Weezy, I'm almost perfect
And I work harder than hard workin'
Bizarre circus, that's when my bars surface
Therefore I act a clown
Even when I'm layin' on my back I'm never backin' down
So over-stand me
I got a condo in Miami and my doormat is always sandy
And I run Louisiana, but I've never pulled a hammy
And I got a condo in Atlanta, and I always wear a bandana
And when it comes down to stuntin', you boys are just buntin'
And I'm swingin' for the fence, your girl hangin' from my dick
Your girl singin' to my shit, like, ""a-la-la-lollipop""
She say I get that pussy wetter than a Dasani shop
And she say I freak that pussy better
Better than her gynecologist, ho just
Text me whenever you want some more dick
More dick, old bitch, young bitch
But I be like damn, all I got is one dick

232,Uptown,"[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, hardly home but always reppin'
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake, you always restin'
And when they call you the answer, you are hardly questioned
I, I'm doin' classic shit in all my sessions
Other niggas' situations, they are all depressin'
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions
I just always did my own thing
Now I run the game, you stupid motha-suckas
I see all this money through my Ohio State Buckeyes
Shit been goin' good, but good can turn to better
'Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her
[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends

It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, wrong way down a one-way
Women don't get saved 'round me, even on a Sunday
Damn, where I get it from? These niggas always wonder who
Then they meet my pop and tell him, ""Drake is just a younger you""
And shawty wanna party, so don't let yo' girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin' her mouth-to-mouth
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I drive two black cars, I named 'em Malcolm X and Martin Luther
I don't ever play, but I'm in the game lady
They just lose to love, those are tennis games, lady
Have you countin' money, goin' duffle bag crazy
Sippin' on Pink Floyd and puffin' Wayne Brady
Damn, whose line is it anyways?
I'm in a daze, you been amazed
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire, yup, I've been ablaze
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right, you look nice
And yo' frame makes me wanna bowl a strike, well alright
Guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real
Put it to your life

All you ever asked me for was time, whoa

235,The Calm,"[Verse 1]
Uh
I'm just so far gone
October's own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on?
Where did we go wrong?
Where do we belong?
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meanin' if it rains, I'm the one it's rainin' on
When my diamond chain is on, still nothin' set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city than these rappers that have blown
It's only been three years
Look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone
I call this shit the calm
Yeah, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be okay and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school, it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry, it'll be better if you don't 'cause
[Break]
You know everything gon' be all right, I promise
I apologize to you know, put y'all in this position, vent to y'all but
40 Mama always say don’t ask permission
Just ask forgiveness you know so uh, forgive me, yeah, yeah
Say

[Verse 2]
Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became trying to make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile, unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention, therefore, women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame
Tryin' to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spotting me is playing
So I'm lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain
Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange
'Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I can only feel his pain
'Cause in Memphis, Tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me, I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why your girl heart is in a sling
Call me ""Heartbreak Drake"", I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man, I'm just honest, as an artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain
Yeah, and see, this is the thang
What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single-handed reason I remain me, yeah

237,Brand New,"[Verse 1]
This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do, you're used to it
And I hate hearing stories 'bout who you've been with
That's when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I'm confident, and damn
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedestal, are we moving too fast?
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask
[Chorus]
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (Brand new), brand new (Brand new), brand new
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
(Is anything I'm doin' brand new?)
Brand new (Brand new), brand new, brand new, brand new
Oh, girl (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2]
This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside
So I don't ever question you, and damn
I can't even find the perfect brush
So I can paint what's going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask

[Chorus]
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (Brand new), brand new (Brand new), brand new
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
(Is anything I'm doin' brand new?)
Brand new (Brand new), brand new, brand new, brand new
Oh, girl (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
New, new, new, new, new
Or is everything I'm doing too late?
Late, late, late, late

238,Congratulations,"[Verse 1]
Uh, black hearts on my cardigan
At the crib tellin ya girl that we should order-in
Tell G to put his feet up on the ottoman
We just up against a bunch of rappers I go harder than
Damn! I'm so Catriona smarter than
A lot of these niggas swear the coach just brought the starter in
Yeah, and I'm the type to tell ya daughter things
I float high, don't try and cut my water wings
I'm still myself
Suicide bars, I kill myself
Charge it to the game, I bill myself
And I don't feel y'all, but I feel myself
Aunty Doe, tell 'em I deserve a mazel tov
I'm rappin' like a Shepherd with the muzzle off
I'm next to blow, pause
And I can't hear the critics talkin' over the applause {crowd cheers}
Yeah, I tried to tell 'em, Future let 'em know
Send the haters all my love, X and O
I got a black box where suggestions go
But I don't really give a fuck, it's prolly best you know
My reality is brighter than your dreams are
I got your dream girl ridin' in your dream car
Yeah, and the visual is stunnin'
I hope they document what I'm becomin'
Congratulations
[Verse 2]
So what you want an award or somethin'?
I'm at the private airport boardin' somethin'
I see nothing from afar but I'm far from nothing
Put on your poker face, I'll pull ya card if you're bluffin'
But I ain't with the hard talk
I got a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk
Like I said we pull your card and find out you're a Hallmark
Just know I'm breakin' world records, no false start
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or somethin'
My deal like Weezy first week, one point somethin'
And my verses gettin' stupider
Wayne if you're on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter?
Phone blowin' up, so I'm cuttin' off my cellular
I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down, when I, when I break it down
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But, you could never beat my ass, pause
Again, dammit y'all, again
Y'all, pretend that we are, some men that get it on, and in
I'll die before I lose, 'cause I was born, to win
If he don't fuck with y'all, then don't bother him

When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back, back

I'm up first, I'm on tour, got a girl, she from the South
Used to work, used to dance in Texas, now she clean the house
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about
On my way, money taught me Spanish, make it ándale
Way up north, packed in Honda cars
They don't know who we are
Fuck 'em all, they only pussy niggas shootin' at the star
Right or wrong, I'ma write my wrongs
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go

[Chorus]
Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure (Man, man)
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

[Verse 1]
What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out, we haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go, you know that I did
I don't know if you know, but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and then let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well, he'll understand
Pull up, I'm pullin' up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna, I'll say it again (Six-six-six!)
Soon as you get in (Oh no, no)

She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, ""I heard you back with you know who""
I told her, ""girl, I'm always back with you know who,"" yeah

Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solvin'

And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life

Maybe one day, but even one day with us is the time of her life

Yeah
Yeah

[Verse]
Oh, you gotta love it, oh, you got—oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow I always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see 'em take at me, they all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep wanting more
Tryna decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a lil, lil homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside
Oh, you tried? It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual
My career's like a how-to manual, so I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah
I know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we had words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing
Crazy this year—fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait 'til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it
And then they start to ""R.I.P."" about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it—
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject
I been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca
Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance
Part in my hair again, that's that comeback flow
Comeback flow, once I start it's apparent
I'm with a girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
""Best I Ever Had"" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace?
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it, yeah
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But, man, oh, you gotta love it (Oh)
Yeah
And head to toe, I'm Prada covered (Whoop)
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it
","
yeah
yeah

verse
oh you gotta love it oh you got—oh you gotta love it
i heard what circulated lets get to the bottom of it
i told 1da send me something and i got it covered
somehow i always rise above it
why you think i got my head in the clouds on my last album cover
the game is all mine and im mighty possessive
lil wayne could not have found him a better successor
every shot you see em take at me they all contested
allen iverson shoe deal these niggas all in question
last night i went to sleep wanting more
tryna decide what direction i should go towards
some nights i wish i could go back in life
not to change shit just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight wonder whats next for me
longevity wonder how long theyll check for me
prolly forever if i stay in my zone
i speak on this generation but cant change it alone
i heard a lil lil homie talking reckless in vibe
thats quite a platform you chose you shouldve kept it inside
oh you tried its so childish calling my name on the world stage
you need to act your age and not your girls age
it gets worse by the annual
my careers like a howto manual so i guess its understandable man
oh you gotta love it you gotta love it yeah
i know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get em
to show they outfits off guess they need the attention
i remember when it used to be music that did it
but then again times have changed man who are we kiddin
im managed by my friends that i grew up with
id rather give that 15 to people i fuck with
if me and future hadnt made it with this rappin
wed prolly be out in silicon tryna get our billions on
but here we are yeah
lately i feel the haters eatin away at my confidence
they scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
bitches alter my messages like we had words
and stories bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
bitter women im overtextin are pmsing
crazy this year—fuckin with my image
ive been tryna reach the youth so i can save em this year
fuck it i guess i gotta wait til next year
and i heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
bout how we need protection from those protectin the block
nobody lookin out for nobody
maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
instead of bein somebody that makes the news so everybody can tweet about it
and then they start to rip about it
and four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
damn i just had to say my piece about it
oh you gotta love it—
but they scared of the truth so back to me showin out in public thats a hotter subject
i been whippin mercedes and nigga try to budget
i gotta make it back to memphis to check on my cousins
shout out to ashley tasha bianca
julia ericka southern america
part of my heritage pardon my arrogance
part in my hair again thats that comeback flow
comeback flow once i start its apparent
im with a girl who ass is so big thats partly embarrassin
but fuck all the blushin and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement
your content so aggressive lately whats irkin you
shit is gettin so personal in your verses too
i wanna prove that im number one over all these niggas
bein number two is just being the first to lose
my city dictated music nobody seein us
winter here already but somehow im heatin up
been observin the game and felt like ive seen enough
lets drop a tape on these niggas then well see wassup
yeah boy you rappin like you seen it all
you rappin like the throne should be the three of yall
best i ever had seems like a decade ago
decadent flow and i still got a decade to go
oh please take it ease wheres the love and the peace
why you rappin like you come from the streets
i got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
and im never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
phantom slidin like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
i cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
special order for anybody thats comin for me
shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
you see they got me back talkin like its just 40 oli and me
cuttin all loose ends i be the barber for free
im almost at four minutes goin off on the beat
feel like im in the malibu that had the cloth on the seats
man oh you gotta love it yeah
and on top of that its getting harder to eat
rappers downgrading houses putting cars on the lease
to think labels said theyd have a problem marketing me
and now its everybody else thats getting hard to believe
but man oh you gotta love it oh
yeah
and head to toe im prada covered whoop
i know your girl well just not in public
blame the city im a product of it
young nigga from the city
you gotta love it

Do what you want when you poppin', don't fold up
When I'm feelin' the stress, then I pour up
Reppin' the set like a soldier
Hop out a Benz when I roll up
I wasn't splurging on purpose
You lame niggas makin' me nervous
I keep me a banger like Birdie
Sip out my cup and it's dirty

Yeah

[Verse]
Never thought I'd be talkin' from this perspective
But I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
'Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I'll say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together (6)
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well-done seared scallops that were to die for
But I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talkin' bigger shit than you and I
Kids are losin' lives, got me scared of losin' mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flyin' over Chattanooga, out here tryna spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google, yeah
Back in the city, shit is gettin' brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle, then take a girl to the movies
They been droppin' out on both sides
We ain't in it, we just ghostride
The pen is workin' if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just makin' moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concernin'
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returnin'
Shit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30
Banners are ready case we need to retire your jersey, yeah
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championship celebrations durin' regular season
Paternity testin' for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoidin' distraction
Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Aw, nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to ""Closer to My Dreams""
Wide-eyed and uneducated at nineteen
I can't rap like that, all young and naïve
Not after all the shit I seen and the things I believe
Drastically changin', thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
Four thousand square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and niggas' crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother
The season start and I don't wanna see you end up with nothin'
Y'all throw the word ""family"" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was comin'
They knees give out and they passin' to you all of the sudden
Now you the one gettin' buckets
They put they arm around you, now you becomin' the crutches
Kids got on your number 'cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you
Or convince you that they care and see where it goes from there, but
These ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action
The hate is just bringin' me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie, then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes, but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep the shit to ourself
Papi champú, young Pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I
Was destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I.
And Young Dro was poppin' off with ""Ain't I""
Way before niggas had they hands out like they doin' macarena
But, who am I to complain now? I'm still around, they know
Yeah","
